EcomScriptBench: A Multi-task Benchmark for E-commerce Script Planning via Step-wise Intention-Driven Product Association,"['Weiqi Wang', 'Limeng Cui', 'Xin Liu', 'Sreyashi Nag', 'Wenju Xu', 'Chen Luo', 'Sheikh Muhammad Sarwar', 'Yang Li', 'Hansu Gu', 'Hui Liu', 'Changlong Yu', 'Jiaxin Bai', 'Yifan Gao', 'Haiyang Zhang', 'Qi He', 'Shuiwang Ji', 'Yangqiu Song']","Goal-oriented script planning, or the ability to devise coherent sequences of actions toward specific goals, is commonly employed by humans to plan for typical activities. In e-commerce, customers increasingly seek LLM-based assistants to generate scripts and recommend products at each step, thereby facilitating convenient and efficient shopping experiences. However, this capability remains underexplored due to several challenges, including the inability of LLMs to simultaneously conduct script planning and product retrieval, difficulties in matching products caused by semantic discrepancies between planned actions and search queries, and a lack of methods and benchmark data for evaluation. In this paper, we step forward by formally defining the task of E-commerce Script Planning (EcomScript) as three sequential subtasks. We propose a novel framework that enables the scalable generation of product-enriched scripts by associating products with each step based on the semantic similarity between the actions and their purchase intentions. By applying our framework to real-world e-commerce data, we construct the very first large-scale EcomScript dataset, EcomScriptBench, which includes 605,229 scripts sourced from 2.4 million products. Human annotations are then conducted to provide gold labels for a sampled subset, forming an evaluation benchmark. Extensive experiments reveal that current (L)LMs face significant challenges with EcomScript tasks, even after fine-tuning, while injecting product purchase intentions improves their performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15196v1

ELABORATION: A Comprehensive Benchmark on Human-LLM Competitive Programming,"['Xinwei Yang', 'Zhaofeng Liu', 'Chen Huang', 'Jiashuai Zhang', 'Tong Zhang', 'Yifan Zhang', 'Wenqiang Lei']","While recent research increasingly emphasizes the value of human-LLM collaboration in competitive programming and proposes numerous empirical methods, a comprehensive understanding remains elusive due to the fragmented nature of existing studies and their use of diverse, application-specific human feedback. Thus, our work serves a three-fold purpose: First, we present the first taxonomy of human feedback consolidating the entire programming process, which promotes fine-grained evaluation. Second, we introduce ELABORATIONSET, a novel programming dataset specifically designed for human-LLM collaboration, meticulously annotated to enable large-scale simulated human feedback and facilitate costeffective real human interaction studies. Third, we introduce ELABORATION, a novel benchmark to facilitate a thorough assessment of human-LLM competitive programming. With ELABORATION, we pinpoint strengthes and weaknesses of existing methods, thereby setting the foundation for future improvement.

The Impossibility of Fair LLMs,"['Jacy Reese Anthis', 'Kristian Lum', 'Michael Ekstrand', 'Avi Feller', 'Chenhao Tan']","The rise of general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised pressing moral questions about how to reduce bias and ensure fairness at scale. Researchers have documented a sort of ""bias"" in the significant correlations between demographics (e.g., race, gender) in LLM prompts and responses, but it remains unclear how LLM fairness could be evaluated with more rigorous definitions, such as group fairness or fair representations. We analyze a variety of technical fairness frameworks and find inherent challenges in each that make the development of a fair LLM intractable. We show that each framework either does not logically extend to the general-purpose AI context or is infeasible in practice, primarily due to the large amounts of unstructured training data and the many potential combinations of human populations, use cases, and sensitive attributes. These inherent challenges would persist for general-purpose AI, including LLMs, even if empirical challenges, such as limited participatory input and limited measurement methods, were overcome. Nonetheless, fairness will remain an important type of model evaluation, and there are still promising research directions, particularly the development of standards for the responsibility of LLM developers, context-specific evaluations, and methods of iterative, participatory, and AI-assisted evaluation that could scale fairness across the diverse contexts of modern human-AI interaction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03198v2
Intuitive Fine-Tuning: Towards Simplifying Alignment into a Single Process,"['Ermo Hua', 'Biqing Qi', 'Kaiyan Zhang', 'Kai Tian', 'Xingtai Lv', 'Ning Ding', 'Bowen Zhou']","Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Preference Optimization (PO) are two fundamental processes for enhancing the capabilities of Language Models (LMs) post pre-training, aligning them better with human preferences. Although SFT advances in training efficiency, PO delivers better alignment, thus they are often combined. However, common practices simply apply them sequentially without integrating their optimization objectives, ignoring the opportunities to bridge their paradigm gap and take the strengths from both. To obtain a unified understanding, we interpret SFT and PO with two sub-processes -- Preference Estimation and Transition Optimization -- defined at token level within the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. This modeling shows that SFT is only a specialized case of PO with inferior estimation and optimization. PO evaluates the quality of model's entire generated answer, whereas SFT only scores predicted tokens based on preceding tokens from target answers. Therefore, SFT overestimates the ability of model, leading to inferior optimization. Building on this view, we introduce Intuitive Fine-Tuning (IFT) to integrate SFT and Preference Optimization into a single process. IFT captures LMs' intuitive sense of the entire answers through a temporal residual connection, but it solely relies on a single policy and the same volume of non-preference-labeled data as SFT. Our experiments show that IFT performs comparably or even superiorly to sequential recipes of SFT and some typical Preference Optimization methods across several tasks, particularly those requires generation, reasoning, and fact-following abilities. An explainable Frozen Lake game further validates the effectiveness of IFT for getting competitive policy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11870v2

Sliding Windows Are Not the End: Exploring Full Ranking with Long-Context Large Language Models,"['Wenhan Liu', 'Xinyu Ma', 'Yutao Zhu', 'Ziliang Zhao', 'Shuaiqiang Wang', 'Dawei Yin', 'Zhicheng Dou']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exciting performance in listwise passage ranking. Due to the limited input length, existing methods often adopt the sliding window strategy. Such a strategy, though effective, is inefficient as it involves repetitive and serialized processing, which usually re-evaluates relevant passages multiple times. As a result, it incurs redundant API costs, which are proportional to the number of inference tokens. The development of long-context LLMs enables the full ranking of all passages within a single inference, avoiding redundant API costs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of long-context LLMs for ranking tasks in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that full ranking with long-context LLMs can deliver superior performance in the supervised fine-tuning setting with a huge efficiency improvement. Furthermore, we identify two limitations of fine-tuning the full ranking model based on existing methods: (1) sliding window strategy fails to produce a full ranking list as a training label, and (2) the language modeling loss cannot emphasize top-ranked passage IDs in the label. To alleviate these issues, we propose a new complete listwise label construction approach and a novel importance-aware learning objective for full ranking. Experiments show the superior performance of our method over baselines. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/8421BCD/fullrank}.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14574v1
The Impact of Auxiliary Patient Data on Automated Chest X-Ray Report Generation and How to Incorporate It,"['Aaron Nicolson', 'Shengyao Zhuang', 'Jason Dowling', 'Bevan Koopman']","This study investigates the integration of diverse patient data sources into multimodal language models for automated chest X-ray (CXR) report generation. Traditionally, CXR report generation relies solely on CXR images and limited radiology data, overlooking valuable information from patient health records, particularly from emergency departments. Utilising the MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-IV-ED datasets, we incorporate detailed patient information such as vital signs, medicines, and clinical history to enhance diagnostic accuracy. We introduce a novel approach to transform these heterogeneous data sources into embeddings that prompt a multimodal language model; this significantly enhances the diagnostic accuracy of generated radiology reports. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the benefits of using a broader set of patient data, underscoring the potential for enhanced diagnostic capabilities and better patient outcomes through the integration of multimodal data in CXR report generation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13181v2

To bridge the gap, we introduce **CLEME2.0**, a reference-based metric describing four fundamental aspects of GEC systems: hit-correction, wrong-correction, under-correction, and over-correction. They collectively contribute to exposing critical qualities and locating drawbacks of GEC systems. Evaluating systems by combining these aspects also leads to superior human consistency over other reference-based and reference-less metrics. Extensive experiments on two human judgment datasets and six reference datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving a new state-of-the-art result.

Prior work on hypothesis generation can be broadly categorized into theory-driven and data-driven approaches. While both have proven effective in generating novel and plausible hypotheses, it remains an open question whether they can complement each other. To address this, we develop the first method that combines literature-based insights with data to perform LLM-powered hypothesis generation. We apply our method on five different datasets and demonstrate that integrating literature and data outperforms other baselines (8.97\% over few-shot, 15.75\% over literature-based alone, and 3.37\% over data-driven alone). Additionally, we conduct the first human evaluation to assess the utility of LLM-generated hypotheses in assisting human decision-making on two challenging tasks: deception detection and AI generated content detection. Our results show that human accuracy improves significantly by 7.44\% and 14.19\% on these tasks, respectively. These findings suggest that integrating literature-based and data-driven approaches provides a comprehensive and nuanced framework for hypothesis generation and could open new avenues for scientific inquiry.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17309v3
GAPO: Learning Preferential Prompt through Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization,"['Zhouhong Gu', 'Xingzhou Chen', 'Xiaoran Shi', 'Tao Wang', 'Suhang Zheng', 'Tianyu Li', 'Hongwei Feng', 'Yanghua Xiao']","Recent advances in large language models have highlighted the critical need for precise control over model outputs through predefined constraints. While existing methods attempt to achieve this through either direct instruction-response synthesis or preferential response optimization, they often struggle with constraint understanding and adaptation. This limitation becomes particularly evident when handling fine-grained constraints, leading to either hallucination or brittle performance. We introduce Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel framework that combines GAN-based training dynamics with an encoder-only reward model to progressively learn and adapt to increasingly complex constraints. GAPO leverages adversarial training to automatically generate training samples of varying difficulty while utilizing the encoder-only architecture to better capture prompt-response relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate GAPO's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained constraint handling, where it significantly outperforms existing methods like PPO, DPO, and KTO. Our results suggest that GAPO's unique approach to preferential prompt learning offers a more robust and effective solution for controlling LLM outputs.

Delving into Multilingual Ethical Bias: The MSQAD with Statistical Hypothesis Tests for Large Language Models,"['Seunguk Yu', 'Juhwan Choi', 'YoungBin Kim']","Despite the recent strides in large language models, studies have underscored the existence of social biases within these systems. In this paper, we delve into the validation and comparison of the ethical biases of LLMs concerning globally discussed and potentially sensitive topics, hypothesizing that these biases may arise from language-specific distinctions. Introducing the Multilingual Sensitive Questions & Answers Dataset (MSQAD), we collected news articles from Human Rights Watch covering 17 topics, and generated socially sensitive questions along with corresponding responses in multiple languages. We scrutinized the biases of these responses across languages and topics, employing two statistical hypothesis tests. The results showed that the null hypotheses were rejected in most cases, indicating biases arising from cross-language differences. It demonstrates that ethical biases in responses are widespread across various languages, and notably, these biases were prevalent even among different LLMs. By making the proposed MSQAD openly available, we aim to facilitate future research endeavors focused on examining cross-language biases in LLMs and their variant models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19121v2
ReSCORE: Label-free Iterative Retriever Training for Multi-hop Question Answering with Relevance-Consistency Supervision,"['Dosung Lee', 'Wonjun Oh', 'Boyoung Kim', 'Minyoung Kim', 'Joonsuk Park', 'Paul Hongsuck Seo']","Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) involves reasoning across multiple documents to answer complex questions. Dense retrievers typically outperform sparse methods like BM25 by leveraging semantic embeddings; however, they require labeled query-document pairs for fine-tuning. This poses a significant challenge in MHQA due to the high variability of queries (reformulated) questions throughout the reasoning steps. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Retriever Supervision with Consistency and Relevance (ReSCORE), a novel method for training dense retrievers for MHQA without labeled documents. ReSCORE leverages large language models to capture each documents relevance to the question and consistency with the correct answer and use them to train a retriever within an iterative question-answering framework. Experiments on three MHQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ReSCORE, with significant improvements in retrieval, and in turn, the state-of-the-art MHQA performance.

MIRAGE: Exploring How Large Language Models Perform in Complex Social Interactive Environments,"['Yin Cai', 'Zhouhong Gu', 'Zhaohan Du', 'Zheyu Ye', 'Shaosheng Cao', 'Yiqian xu', 'Hongwei Feng', 'Ping Chen']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in environmental perception, reasoning-based decision-making, and simulating complex human behaviors, particularly in interactive role-playing contexts. This paper introduces the Multiverse Interactive Role-play Ability General Evaluation (MIRAGE), a comprehensive framework designed to assess LLMs' proficiency in portraying advanced human behaviors through murder mystery games. MIRAGE features eight intricately crafted scripts encompassing diverse themes and styles, providing a rich simulation. To evaluate LLMs' performance, MIRAGE employs four distinct methods: the Trust Inclination Index (TII) to measure dynamics of trust and suspicion, the Clue Investigation Capability (CIC) to measure LLMs' capability of conducting information, the Interactivity Capability Index (ICI) to assess role-playing capabilities and the Script Compliance Index (SCI) to assess LLMs' capability of understanding and following instructions.

FACT-AUDIT: An Adaptive Multi-Agent Framework for Dynamic Fact-Checking Evaluation of Large Language Models,"['Hongzhan Lin', 'Yang Deng', 'Yuxuan Gu', 'Wenxuan Zhang', 'Jing Ma', 'See-Kiong Ng', 'Tat-Seng Chua']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the fact-checking studies. However, existing automated fact-checking evaluation methods rely on static datasets and classification metrics, which fail to automatically evaluate the justification production and uncover the nuanced limitations of LLMs in fact-checking. In this work, we introduce FACT-AUDIT, an agent-driven framework that adaptively and dynamically assesses LLMs' fact-checking capabilities. Leveraging importance sampling principles and multi-agent collaboration, FACT-AUDIT generates adaptive and scalable datasets, performs iterative model-centric evaluations, and updates assessments based on model-specific responses. By incorporating justification production alongside verdict prediction, this framework provides a comprehensive and evolving audit of LLMs' factual reasoning capabilities, to investigate their trustworthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FACT-AUDIT effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LLMs, providing valuable insights into model strengths and limitations in model-centric fact-checking analysis.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17924v2
Statistical Deficiency for Task Inclusion Estimation,"['Loïc Fosse', 'Frederic Bechet', 'Benoit Favre', 'Géraldine Damnati', 'Gwénolé Lecorvé', 'Maxime DARRIN', 'Philippe Formont', 'Pablo Piantanida']","Tasks are central in machine learning, as they are the most natural objects to assess the capabilities of current models. The trend is to build general models able to address any task. Even though transfer learning and multitask learning try to leverage the underlying task space, no well-founded tools are available to study its structure. This study proposes a theoretically grounded setup to define the notion of task and to compute the {\bf inclusion} between two tasks from a statistical deficiency point of view. We propose a tractable proxy as information sufficiency to estimate the degree of inclusion between tasks, show its soundness on synthetic data, and use it to reconstruct empirically the classic NLP pipeline.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05491v2
Towards Robust and Efficient Federated Low-Rank Adaptation with Heterogeneous Clients,"['Jabin Koo', 'Minwoo Jang', 'Jungseul Ok']","Federated fine-tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs) faces significant challenges due to the heavy communication overhead of transmitting large model updates. Although Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed as a solution, yet its application in federated learning is complicated by discordance in aggregation. Existing methods addressing this discordance often suffer from performance degradation at low ranks in heterogeneous data settings. In response, we introduce LoRA-A$^2$ (Low Rank Adaptation with Alternating freeze and Adaptive rank selection), which demonstrates robustness in challenging settings with low ranks and high data heterogeneity. Our experimental findings reveal that LoRA-A$^2$ maintains performance even under extreme heterogeneity and low rank conditions, achieving up to a significant reduction in uploaded parameters compared to full fine-tuning without compromising performance. This adaptive mechanism increases robustness and communication efficiency in federated fine-tuning, enabling the practical deployment of LLMs in resource-constrained environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22815v2
Dynamic Label Name Refinement for Few-Shot Dialogue Intent Classification,"['Gyutae Park', 'Ingeol Baek', 'Byeongjeong Kim', 'Joongbo Shin', 'Hwanhee Lee']","Dialogue intent classification aims to identify the underlying purpose or intent of a user's input in a conversation. Current intent classification systems encounter considerable challenges, primarily due to the vast number of possible intents and the significant semantic overlap among similar intent classes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to few-shot dialogue intent classification through in-context learning, incorporating dynamic label refinement to address these challenges. Our method retrieves relevant examples for a test input from the training set and leverages a large language model to dynamically refine intent labels based on semantic understanding, ensuring that intents are clearly distinguishable from one another. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves confusion between semantically similar intents, resulting in significantly enhanced performance across multiple datasets compared to baselines. We also show that our method generates more interpretable intent labels, and has a better semantic coherence in capturing underlying user intents compared to baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15603v1
LLM-Powered Test Case Generation for Detecting Bugs in Plausible Programs,"['Kaibo Liu', 'Zhenpeng Chen', 'Yiyang Liu', 'Jie Zhang', 'Mark Harman', 'Yudong Han', 'Yun Ma', 'Yihong Dong', 'Ge Li', 'Gang Huang']","Detecting tricky bugs in plausible programs, those that pass existing test suites yet still contain bugs, remains a significant challenge in software testing. To address this problem, we propose TrickCatcher, an LLM-powered approach to generating test cases for uncovering bugs in plausible programs. TrickCatcher operates in three stages: First, it uses an LLM to generate program variants based on the program under test (PUT) and its specification. Second, it employs an LLM to construct an input generator from the specification for producing test inputs. Finally, these inputs are executed on both the PUT and its program variants to detect inconsistencies in their outputs. We evaluate TrickCatcher on two datasets, TrickyBugs and EvalPlus, which include 366 human-written and 151 AI-generated plausible programs with tricky bugs. TrickCatcher achieves recall, precision, and F1 scores that are 1.80x, 2.65x, and 1.66x those of the state-of-the-art baselines, respectively.

Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge,"['Li Zheng', 'Sihang Wang', 'Hao Fei', 'Zuquan Peng', 'Fei Li', 'Jianming Fu', 'Chong Teng', 'Donghong Ji']","Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15504v1

Covering three practical domains -- airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations -- RuleArena assesses LLMs' proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications. Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform accurate mathematical computations, even when they correctly identify the relevant rules, and (3) in general, they perform poorly in the benchmark. We also observe a significant performance boost when LLMs are provided with external tools for oracle math and logic operations.

However, existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and redundancy. First, they overlook the diversity of task difficulties, leading to unnecessarily extensive searches even for easy tasks. Second, they neglect the semantics of reasoning paths, resulting in redundant exploration of semantically identical paths. To address these limitations, we propose Semantic Exploration with Adaptive Gating (SEAG), a computationally efficient method. SEAG employs an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically decides whether to conduct a tree search, based on the confidence level of answers from a preceding simple reasoning method. Furthermore, its tree-based exploration consolidates semantically identical reasoning steps, reducing redundant explorations while maintaining or even improving accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SEAG significantly improves accuracy by 4.3% on average while requiring only 31% of computational costs compared to existing tree search-based methods on complex reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K and ARC with diverse language models such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral.

We develop TrimLLM based on the layer-wise specialization phenomenon we empirically observed and verified on contemporary LLMs. TrimLLM reduces the depth of LLMs via progressive layer dropping. We show it retains LLMs' capacity in specific domains and achieves inference speedup irrespective of hardware and deep learning frameworks. We evaluated TrimLLM on LLMs of various sizes for inference; models adapted on medical, legal, and financial datasets all demonstrate $2.1-5.7\times$ inference speedup on consumer GPUs and up to $3.1\times$ speedup on A100 when compared to state-of-the-art model compression algorithms, with no loss in accuracy at 50$\sim$60\% model compression ratio.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11242v2
JuStRank: Benchmarking LLM Judges for System Ranking,"['Ariel Gera', 'Odellia Boni', 'Yotam Perlitz', 'Roy Bar-Haim', 'Lilach Eden', 'Asaf Yehudai']","Given the rapid progress of generative AI, there is a pressing need to systematically compare and choose between the numerous models and configurations available. The scale and versatility of such evaluations make the use of LLM-based judges a compelling solution for this challenge. Crucially, this approach requires first to validate the quality of the LLM judge itself. Previous work has focused on instance-based assessment of LLM judges, where a judge is evaluated over a set of responses, or response pairs, while being agnostic to their source systems. We argue that this setting overlooks critical factors affecting system-level ranking, such as a judge's positive or negative bias towards certain systems. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study of LLM judges as system rankers. System scores are generated by aggregating judgment scores over multiple system outputs, and the judge's quality is assessed by comparing the resulting system ranking to a human-based ranking. Beyond overall judge assessment, our analysis provides a fine-grained characterization of judge behavior, including their decisiveness and bias.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09569v2

For the task of Relation Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts. Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of the generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly performing RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated samples may lead to better performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23108v1
MultiSocial: Multilingual Benchmark of Machine-Generated Text Detection of Social-Media Texts,"['Dominik Macko', 'Jakub Kopál', 'Robert Moro', 'Ivan Srba']","Recent LLMs are able to generate high-quality multilingual texts, indistinguishable for humans from authentic human-written ones. Research in machine-generated text detection is however mostly focused on the English language and longer texts, such as news articles, scientific papers or student essays. Social-media texts are usually much shorter and often feature informal language, grammatical errors, or distinct linguistic items (e.g., emoticons, hashtags). There is a gap in studying the ability of existing methods in detection of such texts, reflected also in the lack of existing multilingual benchmark datasets. To fill this gap we propose the first multilingual (22 languages) and multi-platform (5 social media platforms) dataset for benchmarking machine-generated text detection in the social-media domain, called MultiSocial. It contains 472,097 texts, of which about 58k are human-written and approximately the same amount is generated by each of 7 multilingual LLMs. We use this benchmark to compare existing detection methods in zero-shot as well as fine-tuned form. Our results indicate that the fine-tuned detectors have no problem to be trained on social-media texts and that the platform selection for training matters.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12549v1
Efficient and Accurate Prompt Optimization: the Benefit of Memory in Exemplar-Guided Reflection,"['Cilin Yan', 'Jingyun Wang', 'Lin Zhang', 'Ruihui Zhao', 'Xiaopu Wu', 'Kai Xiong', 'Qingsong Liu', 'Guoliang Kang', 'Yangyang Kang']","Automatic prompt engineering aims to enhance the generation quality of large language models (LLMs). Recent works utilize feedbacks generated from erroneous cases to guide the prompt optimization. During inference, they may further retrieve several semantically-related exemplars and concatenate them to the optimized prompts to improve the performance. However, those works only utilize the feedback at the current step, ignoring historical and unseleccted feedbacks which are potentially beneficial. Moreover, the selection of exemplars only considers the general semantic relationship and may not be optimal in terms of task performance and matching with the optimized prompt. In this work, we propose an Exemplar-Guided Reflection with Memory mechanism (ERM) to realize more efficient and accurate prompt optimization. Specifically, we design an exemplar-guided reflection mechanism where the feedback generation is additionally guided by the generated exemplars. We further build two kinds of memory to fully utilize the historical feedback information and support more effective exemplar retrieval. Empirical evaluations show our method surpasses previous state-of-the-arts with less optimization steps, i.e., improving F1 score by 10.1 on LIAR dataset, and reducing half of the optimization steps on ProTeGi.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07446v2
Evaluation of LLM Vulnerabilities to Being Misused for Personalized Disinformation Generation,"['Aneta Zugecova', 'Dominik Macko', 'Ivan Srba', 'Robert Moro', 'Jakub Kopál', 'Katarína Marcinčinová', 'Matúš Mesarčík']","The capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality content indistinguishable by humans from human-written texts rises many concerns regarding their misuse. Previous research has shown that LLMs can be effectively misused for generating disinformation news articles following predefined narratives. Their capabilities to generate personalized (in various aspects) content have also been evaluated and mostly found usable. However, a combination of personalization and disinformation abilities of LLMs has not been comprehensively studied yet. Such a dangerous combination should trigger integrated safety filters of the LLMs, if there are some. This study fills this gap by evaluation of vulnerabilities of recent open and closed LLMs, and their willingness to generate personalized disinformation news articles in English. We further explore whether the LLMs can reliably meta-evaluate the personalization quality and whether the personalization affects the generated-texts detectability. Our results demonstrate the need for stronger safety-filters and disclaimers, as those are not properly functioning in most of the evaluated LLMs. Additionally, our study revealed that the personalization actually reduces the safety-filter activations; thus effectively functioning as a jailbreak. Such behavior must be urgently addressed by LLM developers and service providers.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13666v1

To address this, we introduce EscapeBench, a benchmark suite of room escape game environments designed to challenge agents with creative reasoning, unconventional tool use, and iterative problem-solving to uncover implicit goals. Our results show that current LM models, despite employing working memory and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, achieve only 15% average progress without hints, highlighting their limitations in creativity. To bridge this gap, we propose EscapeAgent, a framework designed to enhance creative reasoning through Foresight (innovative tool use) and Reflection (identifying unsolved tasks). Experiments show that EscapeAgent can execute action chains over 1,000 steps while maintaining logical coherence. It navigates and completes games with up to 40% fewer steps and hints, performs robustly across difficulty levels, and achieves higher action success rates with more efficient and innovative puzzle-solving strategies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13549v2

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves documents to assist large language models (LLMs) in question answering; while Graph RAG (GRAG) uses structured knowledge bases as its knowledge source. However, many questions require both textual and relational information from SKB - referred to as ""hybrid"" questions - which complicates the retrieval process and underscores the need for a hybrid retrieval method that leverages both information. In this paper, through our empirical analysis, we identify key insights that show why existing methods may struggle with hybrid question answering (HQA) over SKB. Based on these insights, we propose HybGRAG for HQA consisting of a retriever bank and a critic module, with the following advantages: (1) Agentic, it automatically refines the output by incorporating feedback from the critic module, (2) Adaptive, it solves hybrid questions requiring both textual and relational information with the retriever bank, (3) Interpretable, it justifies decision making with intuitive refinement path, and (4) Effective, it surpasses all baselines on HQA benchmarks. In experiments on the STaRK benchmark, HybGRAG achieves significant performance gains, with an average relative improvement in Hit@1 of 51%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16311v2
Re-ranking Using Large Language Models for Mitigating Exposure to Harmful Content on Social Media Platforms,"['Rajvardhan Oak', 'Muhammad Haroon', 'Claire Wonjeong jo', 'Magdalena Wojcieszak', 'Anshuman Chhabra']","Social media platforms utilize Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered recommendation algorithms to maximize user engagement, which can result in inadvertent exposure to harmful content. Current moderation efforts, reliant on classifiers trained with extensive human-annotated data, struggle with scalability and adapting to new forms of harm. To address these challenges, we propose a novel re-ranking approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our method dynamically assesses and re-ranks content sequences, effectively mitigating harmful content exposure without requiring extensive labeled data. Alongside traditional ranking metrics, we also introduce two new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of re-ranking in reducing exposure to harmful content. Through experiments on three datasets, three models and across three configurations, we demonstrate that our LLM-based approach significantly outperforms existing proprietary moderation approaches, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for harm mitigation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13977v3
Aligning AI Research with the Needs of Clinical Coding Workflows: Eight Recommendations Based on US Data Analysis and Critical Review,"['Yidong Gan', 'Maciej Rybinski', 'Ben Hachey', 'Jonathan K. Kummerfeld']","Clinical coding is crucial for healthcare billing and data analysis. Manual clinical coding is labour-intensive and error-prone, which has motivated research towards full automation of the process. However, our analysis, based on US English electronic health records and automated coding research using these records, shows that widely used evaluation methods are not aligned with real clinical contexts. For example, evaluations that focus on the top 50 most common codes are an oversimplification, as there are thousands of codes used in practice. This position paper aims to align AI coding research more closely with practical challenges of clinical coding. Based on our analysis, we offer eight specific recommendations, suggesting ways to improve current evaluation methods.

MIND: A Multi-agent Framework for Zero-shot Harmful Meme Detection,"['Ziyan Liu', 'Chunxiao Fan', 'Haoran Lou', 'Yuexin Wu', 'Kaiwei Deng']","The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection.

EvoWiki: Evaluating LLMs on Evolving Knowledge,"['Wei Tang', 'Yixin Cao', 'Yang Deng', 'Jiahao Ying', 'Bo Wang', 'Yizhe Yang', 'Yuyue Zhao', 'Qi Zhang', 'Xuanjing Huang', 'Yu-Gang Jiang', 'Yong Liao']","Knowledge utilization is a critical aspect of LLMs, and understanding how they adapt to evolving knowledge is essential for their effective deployment. However, existing benchmarks are predominantly static, failing to capture the evolving nature of LLMs and knowledge, leading to inaccuracies and vulnerabilities such as contamination.

EvoWiki is fully auto-updatable, enabling precise evaluation of continuously changing knowledge and newly released LLMs. Through experiments with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Contunual Learning (CL), we evaluate how effectively LLMs adapt to evolving knowledge. Our results indicate that current models often struggle with evolved knowledge, frequently providing outdated or incorrect responses. Moreover, the dataset highlights a synergistic effect between RAG and CL, demonstrating their potential to better adapt to evolving knowledge. EvoWiki provides a robust benchmark for advancing future research on the knowledge evolution capabilities of large language models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13582v1
Rethinking Repetition Problems of LLMs in Code Generation,"['Yihong Dong', 'Yuchen Liu', 'Xue Jiang', 'Zhi Jin', 'Ge Li']","With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of generated code.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10402v1
PunchBench: Benchmarking MLLMs in Multimodal Punchline Comprehension,"['Kun Ouyang', 'Yuanxin Liu', 'Shicheng Li', 'Yi Liu', 'Hao Zhou', 'Fandong Meng', 'Jie Zhou', 'Xu Sun']","Multimodal punchlines, which involve humor or sarcasm conveyed in image-caption pairs, are a popular way of communication on online multimedia platforms. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), it is essential to assess their ability to effectively comprehend these punchlines. However, existing benchmarks on punchline comprehension suffer from three major limitations: 1) language shortcuts that allow models to solely rely on text, 2) lack of question diversity, and 3) narrow focus on a specific domain of multimodal content (e.g., cartoon). To address these limitations, we introduce a multimodal \textbf{Punch}line comprehension \textbf{Bench}mark, named \textbf{PunchBench}, which is tailored for accurate and comprehensive evaluation of punchline comprehension. To enhance the evaluation accuracy, we generate synonymous and antonymous captions by modifying original captions, which mitigates the impact of shortcuts in the captions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, PunchBench incorporates diverse question formats and image-captions from various domains. On this basis, we conduct extensive evaluations and reveal a significant gap between state-of-the-art MLLMs and humans in punchline comprehension. To improve punchline comprehension, we propose Simple-to-Complex Chain-of-Question (SC-CoQ) strategy, enabling the models to incrementally address complicated questions by first mastering simple ones. SC-CoQ effectively enhances the performance of various MLLMs on PunchBench, surpassing in-context learning and chain-of-thought.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11906v2
ProcessBench: Identifying Process Errors in Mathematical Reasoning,"['Chujie Zheng', 'Zhenru Zhang', 'Beichen Zhang', 'Runji Lin', 'Keming Lu', 'Bowen Yu', 'Dayiheng Liu', 'Jingren Zhou', 'Junyang Lin']","As language models regularly make mistakes when solving math problems, automated identification of errors in the reasoning process becomes increasingly significant for their scalable oversight. In this paper, we introduce ProcessBench for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on competition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a step-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models are required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude that all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench, involving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models, where for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each solution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and MATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e., prompted general language models) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly fine-tuned on the PRM800K dataset. (2) The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has demonstrated the critique capability competitive with the proprietary model GPT-4o, despite that it still lags behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini. We hope ProcessBench can foster future research in reasoning process assessment, paving the way toward scalable oversight of language models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06559v4
Model Extrapolation Expedites Alignment,"['Chujie Zheng', 'Ziqi Wang', 'Heng Ji', 'Minlie Huang', 'Nanyun Peng']","Given the high computational cost of preference alignment training of large language models (LLMs), exploring efficient methods to reduce the training overhead remains an important and compelling research problem. Motivated by the observation that alignment training typically involves only small parameter changes without injecting new knowledge into models, we propose a straightforward method called ExPO (model extrapolation) to expedite LLMs' alignment with human preferences. Given a partially-trained model and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO improves the implicit optimization objective of alignment training by simply amplifying the parameter change based on a first-order approximation, without any additional training overhead. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that ExPO boosts a DPO model trained with only 20% steps to outperform the fully-trained one. Moreover, we show that ExPO notably improves existing open-source LLMs (ranging from 1.8B to 70B parameters) on the leading AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench benchmarks, which highlights ExPO's broader utility in efficiently enhancing LLM alignment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16792v5

However, existing mental health LLMs overlook a critical issue where they do not consider the fact that different psychological counselors exhibit different personal styles, including linguistic style and therapy techniques, etc. As a result, these LLMs fail to satisfy the individual needs of clients who seek different counseling styles. To help bridge this gap, we propose PsyDT, a novel framework using LLMs to construct the Digital Twin of Psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. Compared to the time-consuming and costly approach of collecting a large number of real-world counseling cases to create a specific counselor's digital twin, our framework offers a faster and more cost-effective solution. To construct PsyDT, we utilize dynamic one-shot learning by using GPT-4 to capture counselor's unique counseling style, mainly focusing on linguistic style and therapy techniques. Subsequently, using existing single-turn long-text dialogues with client's questions, GPT-4 is guided to synthesize multi-turn dialogues of specific counselor. Finally, we fine-tune the LLMs on the synthetic dataset, PsyDTCorpus, to achieve the digital twin of psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. Experimental results indicate that our proposed PsyDT framework can synthesize multi-turn dialogues that closely resemble real-world counseling cases and demonstrate better performance compared to other baselines, thereby show that our framework can effectively construct the digital twin of psychological counselor with a specific counseling style.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13660v1
BIPro: Zero-shot Chinese Poem Generation via Block Inverse Prompting Constrained Generation Framework,['Xu Zou'],"Recently, generative pre-trained models have made significant strides, particularly highlighted by the release of ChatGPT and GPT-4, which exhibit superior cross-domain capabilities. However, these models still face challenges on constrained writing tasks like poem generation under open-domain titles. In response to this challenge, we introduce Block Inverse Prompting (BIPro) constrained generation framework. BIPro leverages two block inverse prompting methods, revise and rewrite, that mimic the process of human text writing using block generative models. It significantly improves the zero-shot generation quality on the formidable constrained generation task of open-domain traditional-form Chinese poem generation. Based on a less powerful block generative model GLM-10B-Chinese, poems composed via BIPro without priming or additional training outperform both most advanced direct generative systems like GPT-4 or GLM-4 and best domain-specific systems such as Yusheng, Shisanbai, or Baidu Poetry Helper in human evaluation by proficient poets. Finally, BIPro considerably narrows the gap between AI-generated works and short-listed human literary arts in another human evaluation, unveiling the promising potential of block generative models in improving the quality of constrained generation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13237v1
Rethinking KenLM: Good and Bad Model Ensembles for Efficient Text Quality Filtering in Large Web Corpora,"['Yungi Kim', 'Hyunsoo Ha', 'Sukyung Lee', 'Jihoo Kim', 'Seonghoon Yang', 'Chanjun Park']","With the increasing demand for substantial amounts of high-quality data to train large language models (LLMs), efficiently filtering large web corpora has become a critical challenge. For this purpose, KenLM, a lightweight n-gram-based language model that operates on CPUs, is widely used. However, the traditional method of training KenLM utilizes only high-quality data and, consequently, does not explicitly learn the linguistic patterns of low-quality data. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble approach that leverages two contrasting KenLMs: (i) Good KenLM, trained on high-quality data; and (ii) Bad KenLM, trained on low-quality data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces noisy content while preserving high-quality content compared to the traditional KenLM training method.

We present GenSPP, the first interlocking-free architecture for selective rationalization that does not require any learning overhead, as the above-mentioned.

Re-identification of De-identified Documents with Autoregressive Infilling,"['Lucas Georges Gabriel Charpentier', 'Pierre Lison']","Documents revealing sensitive information about individuals must typically be de-identified. This de-identification is often done by masking all mentions of personally identifiable information (PII), thereby making it more difficult to uncover the identity of the person(s) in question. To investigate the robustness of de-identification methods, we present a novel, RAG-inspired approach that attempts the reverse process of re-identification based on a database of documents representing background knowledge. Given a text in which personal identifiers have been masked, the re-identification proceeds in two steps. A retriever first selects from the background knowledge passages deemed relevant for the re-identification. Those passages are then provided to an infilling model which seeks to infer the original content of each text span. This process is repeated until all masked spans are replaced. We evaluate the re-identification on three datasets (Wikipedia biographies, court rulings and clinical notes). Results show that (1) as many as 80% of de-identified text spans can be successfully recovered and (2) the re-identification accuracy increases along with the level of background knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12859v1

However, training models to handle long contexts presents significant challenges. These include the scarcity of high-quality natural long-context data, the potential for performance degradation on short-context tasks, and the reduced training efficiency associated with attention mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce Untie the Knots (\textbf{UtK}), a novel data augmentation strategy employed during the continue pre-training phase, designed to efficiently enable LLMs to gain long-context capabilities without the need to modify the existing data mixture. In particular, we chunk the documents, shuffle the chunks, and create a complex and knotted structure of long texts; LLMs are then trained to untie these knots and identify relevant segments within seemingly chaotic token sequences. This approach greatly improves the model's performance by accurately attending to relevant information in long context and the training efficiency is also largely increased. We conduct extensive experiments on models with 7B and 72B parameters, trained on 20 billion tokens, demonstrating that UtK achieves 75\% and 84.5\% accurracy on RULER at 128K context length, significantly outperforming other long context strategies.

We compare bias estimations with those produced by other evaluation methods using benchmark datasets and assess their alignment with human annotated biases. We extend previous work by evaluating social biases introduced after retraining an MLM under the masked language modeling objective and find proposed measures produce more accurate and sensitive estimations of biases introduced by retraining MLMs based on relative preference for biased sentences between models, while other methods tend to underestimate biases after retraining on sentences biased towards disadvantaged groups.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13954v3

Neural Topic Modeling with Large Language Models in the Loop,"['Xiaohao Yang', 'He Zhao', 'Weijie Xu', 'YUANYUAN QI', 'Jueqing Lu', 'Dinh Phung', 'Lan Du']","Topic modeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing, allowing the discovery of latent thematic structures in text corpora. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in topic discovery, their direct application to topic modeling suffers from issues such as incomplete topic coverage, misalignment of topics, and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-ITL, a novel LLM-in-the-loop framework that integrates LLMs with Neural Topic Models (NTMs). In LLM-ITL, global topics and document representations are learned through the NTM. Meanwhile, an LLM refines these topics using an Optimal Transport (OT)-based alignment objective, where the refinement is dynamically adjusted based on the LLM's confidence in suggesting topical words for each set of input words. With the flexibility of being integrated into many existing NTMs, the proposed approach enhances the interpretability of topics while preserving the efficiency of NTMs in learning topics and document representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM-ITL helps NTMs significantly improve their topic interpretability while maintaining the quality of document representation.

HALoGEN: Fantastic LLM Hallucinations and Where to Find Them,"['Abhilasha Ravichander', 'Shrusti Ghela', 'David Wadden', 'Yejin Choi']","Despite their impressive ability to generate high-quality and fluent text, generative large language models (LLMs) also produce hallucinations: statements that are misaligned with established world knowledge or provided input context. However, measuring hallucination can be challenging, as having humans verify model generations on-the-fly is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we release HALoGEN, a comprehensive hallucination benchmark consisting of: (1) 10,923 prompts for generative models spanning nine domains including programming, scientific attribution, and summarization, and (2) automatic high-precision verifiers for each use case that decompose LLM generations into atomic units, and verify each unit against a high-quality knowledge source. We use this framework to evaluate ~150,000 generations from 14 language models, finding that even the best-performing models are riddled with hallucinations (sometimes up to 86% of generated atomic facts depending on the domain). We further define a novel error classification for LLM hallucinations based on whether they likely stem from incorrect recollection of training data (Type A errors), or incorrect knowledge in training data (Type B errors), or are fabrication (Type C errors). We hope our framework provides a foundation to enable the principled study of why generative models hallucinate, and advances the development of trustworthy large language models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08292v1
Synergizing LLMs with Global Label Propagation for Multimodal Fake News Detection,"['Shuguo Hu', 'Jun Hu', 'Huaiwen Zhang']","Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist multimodal fake news detection by predicting pseudo labels. However, LLM-generated pseudo labels alone demonstrate poor performance compared to traditional detection methods, making their effective integration non-trivial. In this paper, we propose Global Label Propagation Network with LLM-based Pseudo Labeling (GLPN-LLM) for multimodal fake news detection, which integrates LLM capabilities via label propagation techniques. The global label propagation can utilize LLM-generated pseudo labels, enhancing prediction accuracy by propagating label information among all samples. For label propagation, a mask-based mechanism is designed to prevent label leakage during training by ensuring that training nodes do not propagate their own labels back to themselves. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that by synergizing LLMs with label propagation, our model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00488v1

Previous studies have highlighted VLMs' vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, where carefully crafted inputs can lead the model to produce content that violates ethical and legal standards. However, existing methods struggle against state-of-the-art VLMs like GPT-4o, due to the over-exposure of harmful content and lack of stealthy malicious guidance. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework: Multi-Modal Linkage (MML) Attack. Drawing inspiration from cryptography, MML utilizes an encryption-decryption process across text and image modalities to mitigate over-exposure of malicious information. To align the model's output with malicious intent covertly, MML employs a technique called ""evil alignment"", framing the attack within a video game production scenario. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MML's effectiveness. Specifically, MML jailbreaks GPT-4o with attack success rates of 97.80% on SafeBench, 98.81% on MM-SafeBench and 99.07% on HADES-Dataset.

We advocate for the selective removal of tokens based on the average context-aware attention scores rather than average scores across all inputs. LeanCode uses the attention scores of `CLS' tokens within the encoder for classification tasks, such as code search. It also employs the encoder-decoder attention scores to determine token significance for sequence-to-sequence tasks like code summarization.

MARS: Benchmarking the Metaphysical Reasoning Abilities of Language Models with a Multi-task Evaluation Dataset,"['Weiqi Wang', 'Yangqiu Song']","To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as conscious agents with generalizable reasoning capabilities, it is crucial that they possess the reasoning ability to comprehend situational changes (transitions) in distribution triggered by environmental factors or actions from other agents. Despite its fundamental significance, this ability remains underexplored due to the complexity of modeling infinite possible changes in an event and their associated distributions, coupled with the lack of benchmark data with situational transitions. Addressing these gaps, we propose a novel formulation of reasoning with distributional changes as a three-step discriminative process, termed as MetAphysical ReaSoning. We then introduce the first-ever benchmark, MARS, comprising three tasks corresponding to each step. These tasks systematically assess LLMs' capabilities in reasoning the plausibility of (i) changes in actions, (ii) states caused by changed actions, and (iii) situational transitions driven by changes in action. Extensive evaluations with 20 (L)LMs of varying sizes and methods indicate that all three tasks in this process pose significant challenges, even for state-of-the-art LLMs and LMs after fine-tuning. Further analyses reveal potential causes for the underperformance of LLMs and demonstrate that pre-training them on large-scale conceptualization taxonomies can potentially enhance their metaphysical reasoning capabilities.

While prior studies demonstrate the promise of LLMs as error detectors, they overlook the presence of multiple valid solutions for a single MWP. Our preliminary analysis reveals a significant performance gap between conventional and alternative solutions in MWPs, a phenomenon we term conformity bias in this work. To mitigate this bias, we introduce the Ask-Before-Detect (AskBD) framework, which generates adaptive reference solutions using LLMs to enhance error detection. Experiments on 200 examples of GSM8K show that AskBD effectively mitigates bias and improves performance, especially when combined with reasoning-enhancing techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16838v1
Real-time Fake News from Adversarial Feedback,"['Sanxing Chen', 'Yukun Huang', 'Bhuwan Dhingra']","We show that existing evaluations for fake news detection based on conventional sources, such as claims on fact-checking websites, result in high accuracies over time for LLM-based detectors -- even after their knowledge cutoffs. This suggests that recent popular fake news from such sources can be easily detected due to pre-training and retrieval corpus contamination or increasingly salient shallow patterns. Instead, we argue that a proper fake news detection dataset should test a model's ability to reason factually about the current world by retrieving and reading related evidence. To this end, we develop a novel pipeline that leverages natural language feedback from a RAG-based detector to iteratively modify real-time news into deceptive fake news that challenges LLMs. Our iterative rewrite decreases the binary classification ROC-AUC by an absolute 17.5 percent for a strong RAG-based GPT-4o detector. Our experiments reveal the important role of RAG in both detecting and generating fake news, as retrieval-free LLM detectors are vulnerable to unseen events and adversarial attacks, while feedback from RAG detection helps discover more deceitful patterns in fake news.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14651v2

However, current training recipes lack robust CoT reasoning data, relying on datasets dominated by short annotations with minimal rationales. In this work, we show that training VLM on short answers does not generalize well to reasoning tasks that require more detailed responses. To address this, we propose a two-fold approach. First, we distill rationales from GPT-4o model to enrich the training data and fine-tune VLMs, boosting their CoT performance. Second, we apply reinforcement learning to further calibrate reasoning quality. Specifically, we construct positive (correct) and negative (incorrect) pairs of model-generated reasoning chains, by comparing their predictions with annotated short answers. Using this pairwise data, we apply the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm to refine the model's reasoning abilities. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in CoT reasoning on benchmark datasets and better generalization to direct answer prediction as well.

On the Mutual Influence of Gender and Occupation in LLM Representations,"['Haozhe An', 'Connor Baumler', 'Abhilasha Sancheti', 'Rachel Rudinger']","We examine LLM representations of gender for first names in various occupational contexts to study how occupations and the gender perception of first names in LLMs influence each other mutually. We find that LLMs' first-name gender representations correlate with real-world gender statistics associated with the name, and are influenced by the co-occurrence of stereotypically feminine or masculine occupations. Additionally, we study the influence of first-name gender representations on LLMs in a downstream occupation prediction task and their potential as an internal metric to identify extrinsic model biases. While feminine first-name embeddings often raise the probabilities for female-dominated jobs (and vice versa for male-dominated jobs), reliably using these internal gender representations for bias detection remains challenging.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06792v1
Disentangling Memory and Reasoning Ability in Large Language Models,"['Mingyu Jin', 'Weidi Luo', 'Sitao Cheng', 'Xinyi Wang', 'Wenyue Hua', 'Ruixiang Tang', 'William Yang Wang', 'Yongfeng Zhang']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in handling complex tasks requiring both extensive knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, the existing LLM inference pipeline operates as an opaque process without explicit separation between knowledge retrieval and reasoning steps, making the model's decision-making process unclear and disorganized. This ambiguity can lead to issues such as hallucinations and knowledge forgetting, which significantly impact the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we propose a new inference paradigm that decomposes the complex inference process into two distinct and clear actions: (1) memory recall: which retrieves relevant knowledge, and (2) reasoning: which performs logical steps based on the recalled knowledge. To facilitate this decomposition, we introduce two special tokens memory and reason, guiding the model to distinguish between steps that require knowledge retrieval and those that involve reasoning. Our experiment results show that this decomposition not only improves model performance but also enhances the interpretability of the inference process, enabling users to identify sources of error and refine model responses effectively.

However, this places a significant burden on token representations to encode all language-specific information, which may hinder language neutrality. To address this limitation, we propose Language-Script Aware Multilingual Pretraining (LangSAMP), a method that incorporates both language and script embeddings to enhance representation learning. Specifically, we integrate these embeddings into the output of the Transformer blocks before passing the final representations to the language modeling head for prediction. We apply LangSAMP to the continual pretraining of XLM-R on a highly multilingual corpus covering more than 500 languages. The resulting model consistently outperforms the baseline in zero-shot crosslingual transfer across diverse downstream tasks. Extensive analysis reveals that language and script embeddings capture language- and script-specific nuances, which benefits more language-neutral representations, proven by improved pairwise cosine similarity. In our case study, we also show that language and script embeddings can be used to select better source languages for crosslingual transfer.

Using open-ended survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Studies (GLES), we prompt different LLMs to generate synthetic public opinions reflective of German subpopulations by incorporating demographic features into the persona prompts. Our results show that Llama performs better than other LLMs at representing subpopulations, particularly when there is lower opinion diversity within those groups. Our findings further reveal that the LLM performs better for supporters of left-leaning parties like The Greens and The Left compared to other parties, and matches the least with the right-party AfD. Additionally, the inclusion or exclusion of specific variables in the prompts can significantly impact the models' predictions. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLMs to more effectively model diverse public opinions while minimizing political biases and enhancing robustness in representativeness.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13169v2

Self-Instructed Derived Prompt Generation Meets In-Context Learning: Unlocking New Potential of Black-Box LLMs,"['Zhuo Li', 'Yuhao Du', 'Jinpeng Hu', 'Xiang Wan', 'Anningzhe Gao']","Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in generating high-quality responses. In order to achieve better alignment with LLMs with human preference, various works are proposed based on specific optimization process, which, however, is not suitable to Black-Box LLMs like GPT-4, due to inaccessible parameters. In Black-Box LLMs case, their performance is highly dependent on the quality of the provided prompts. Existing methods to enhance response quality often involve a prompt refinement model, yet these approaches potentially suffer from semantic inconsistencies between the refined and original prompts, and typically overlook the relationship between them. To address these challenges, we introduce a self-instructed in-context learning framework that empowers LLMs to deliver more effective responses by generating reliable derived prompts to construct informative contextual environments. Our approach incorporates a self-instructed reinforcement learning mechanism, enabling direct interaction with the response model during derived prompt generation for better alignment. We then formulate querying as an in-context learning task, using responses from LLMs combined with the derived prompts to establish a contextual demonstration for the original prompt. This strategy ensures alignment with the original query, reduces discrepancies from refined prompts, and maximizes the LLMs' in-context learning capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only generates more reliable derived prompts but also significantly enhances LLMs' ability to deliver more effective responses, including Black-Box models such as GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01552v1
Binary Classifier Optimization for Large Language Model Alignment,['Seungjae Jung'],"In real-world services such as ChatGPT, aligning models based on user feedback is crucial for improving model performance. However, due to the simplicity and convenience of providing feedback, users typically offer only basic binary signals, such as 'thumbs-up' or 'thumbs-down'. Most existing alignment research, on the other hand, relies on preference-based approaches that require both positive and negative responses as a pair. We propose Binary Classifier Optimization (BCO), a technique that effectively aligns LLMs using only binary feedback. BCO trains a binary classifier, where the logit serves as an implicit reward, effectively minimizing the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) loss. We demonstrate that the binary cross-entropy loss employed in classifier training acts as an upper bound for the DPO loss. Additionally, a novel reward shift technique further minimizes the gap between the losses. We validate our methodology in two settings: first, on a paired preference dataset, where our method performs on par with DPO; and second, on a Likert-5 scale annotation dataset which stems from real users' queries. Our model consistently demonstrates effective and robust alignment across four base LLMs and three different datasets, showcasing the strength of our approach to learning from binary signals.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04656v2

L4Q: Parameter Efficient Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning on Large Language Models,"['Hyesung Jeon', 'Yulhwa Kim', 'Jae-Joon Kim']","Due to the high memory and computational costs associated with large language models (LLMs), model compression techniques such as quantization, which reduces inference costs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which reduce training costs, have gained significant popularity. This trend has spurred active research into quantization-aware PEFT techniques, aimed at maintaining model accuracy while minimizing memory overhead during both inference and training. Previous quantization-aware PEFT methods typically apply post-training quantization (PTQ) to pre-trained LLMs, followed by PEFT to recover accuracy loss. Meanwhile, this approach has limitations in recovering the accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose L4Q, a method that integrates Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with LoRA. By employing a memory-optimized layer design, L4Q significantly reduces QAT's memory overhead, making its training cost comparable to LoRA, while preserving the advantage of QAT in producing fully quantized LLMs with high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that this combined approach to quantization and fine-tuning achieves superior accuracy compared to decoupled fine-tuning schemes, particularly in 4-bit and 3-bit quantization, positioning L4Q as an efficient QAT solution.

One practical objective for an Arabic LLM is to utilize an Arabic-specific vocabulary for the tokenizer that could speed up decoding.

Inspired by the vocabulary learning during Second Language (Arabic) Acquisition for humans, the released AraLLaMA employs progressive vocabulary expansion, which is implemented by a modified BPE algorithm that progressively extends the Arabic subwords in its dynamic vocabulary during training, thereby balancing the OOV ratio at every stage.

Critically, we find that successful attacks do not require carefully crafted harmful content. Even repetitive shots or random dummy text can circumvent model safety measures, suggesting fundamental limitations in long-context processing capabilities of LLMs. The safety behavior of well-aligned models becomes increasingly inconsistent with longer contexts.

Numerous studies emphasize the significance of the quality of instruction tuning (IT) data, revealing a strong correlation between IT data quality and the alignment performance of LLMs. In these studies, the quality of IT data is typically assessed by evaluating the performance of LLMs trained with that data. However, we identified a prevalent issue in such practice: hyperparameters for training models are often selected arbitrarily without adequate justification. We observed significant variations in hyperparameters applied across different studies, even when training the same model with the same data. In this study, we demonstrate the potential problems arising from this practice and emphasize the need for careful consideration in verifying data quality. Through our experiments on the quality of LIMA data and a selected set of 1,000 Alpaca data points, we demonstrate that arbitrary hyperparameter decisions can make any arbitrary conclusion.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04807v3

Modular Sentence Encoders: Separating Language Specialization from Cross-Lingual Alignment,"['Yongxin Huang', 'Kexin Wang', 'Goran Glavaš', 'Iryna Gurevych']","Multilingual sentence encoders (MSEs) are commonly obtained by training multilingual language models to map sentences from different languages into a shared semantic space. As such, they are subject to curse of multilinguality, a loss of monolingual representational accuracy due to parameter sharing. Another limitation of MSEs is the trade-off between different task performance: cross-lingual alignment training distorts the optimal monolingual structure of semantic spaces of individual languages, harming the utility of sentence embeddings in monolingual tasks; cross-lingual tasks, such as cross-lingual semantic similarity and zero-shot transfer for sentence classification, may also require conflicting cross-lingual alignment strategies. In this work, we address both issues by means of modular training of sentence encoders. We first train language-specific monolingual modules to mitigate negative interference between languages (i.e., the curse). We then align all non-English sentence embeddings to the English by training cross-lingual alignment adapters, preventing interference with monolingual specialization from the first step. We train the cross-lingual adapters with two different types of data to resolve the conflicting requirements of different cross-lingual tasks. Monolingual and cross-lingual results on semantic text similarity and relatedness, bitext mining and sentence classification show that our modular solution achieves better and more balanced performance across all the tasks compared to full-parameter training of monolithic multilingual sentence encoders, especially benefiting low-resource languages.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14878v2
Multimodal Transformers are Hierarchical Modal-wise Heterogeneous Graphs,"['Yijie Jin', 'Junjie Peng', 'Xuanchao Lin', 'Haochen Yuan', 'Lan Wang', 'Cangzhi Zheng']","Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is a rapidly developing field that integrates multimodal information to recognize sentiments, and existing models have made significant progress in this area. The central challenge in MSA is multimodal fusion, which is predominantly addressed by Multimodal Transformers (MulTs). Although act as the paradigm, MulTs suffer from efficiency concerns. In this work, from the perspective of efficiency optimization, we propose and prove that MulTs are hierarchical modal-wise heterogeneous graphs (HMHGs), and we introduce the graph-structured representation pattern of MulTs. Based on this pattern, we propose an Interlaced Mask (IM) mechanism to design the Graph-Structured and Interlaced-Masked Multimodal Transformer (GsiT). It is formally equivalent to MulTs which achieves an efficient weight-sharing mechanism without information disorder through IM, enabling All-Modal-In-One fusion with only 1/3 of the parameters of pure MulTs. A Triton kernel called Decomposition is implemented to ensure avoiding additional computational overhead. Moreover, it achieves significantly higher performance than traditional MulTs. To further validate the effectiveness of GsiT itself and the HMHG concept, we integrate them into multiple state-of-the-art models and demonstrate notable performance improvements and parameter reduction on widely used MSA datasets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01068v1

However, existing methods often focus on specific problems, lacking a comprehensive exploration of the generalization and capability boundaries of SKP. This paper aims to evaluate and rethink the generalization capability of the SKP paradigm from four perspectives including Granularity, Transferability, Scalability, and Universality.

Our key innovation is VENUS, a large-scale dataset comprising annotated videos with time-aligned text, facial expressions, and body language. Leveraging VENUS, we train MARS with a next-token prediction objective, combining text with vector-quantized nonverbal representations to achieve multimodal understanding and generation within a unified framework.

In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and instead examine backdoor attacks through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-readable explanations for their decisions, enabling direct comparisons between explanations for clean and poisoned samples. Our results show that backdoored models produce coherent explanations for clean inputs but diverse and logically flawed explanations for poisoned data, a pattern consistent across classification and generation tasks for different backdoor attacks. Further analysis reveals key insights into the explanation generation process. At the token level, explanation tokens associated with poisoned samples only appear in the final few transformer layers. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention away from the original input context during explanation generation. These findings enhance our understanding of backdoor mechanisms in LLMs and present a promising framework for detecting vulnerabilities through explainability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12701v3

However, due to systematic biases in evaluation datasets, the real-world effectiveness of these models remains unclear, particularly across geographies. We introduce HateDay, the first global hate speech dataset representative of social media settings, constructed from a random sample of all tweets posted on September 21, 2022 and covering eight languages and four English-speaking countries. Using HateDay, we uncover substantial variation in the prevalence and composition of hate speech across languages and regions. We show that evaluations on academic datasets greatly overestimate real-world detection performance, which we find is very low, especially for non-European languages. Our analysis identifies key drivers of this gap, including models' difficulty to distinguish hate from offensive speech and a mismatch between the target groups emphasized in academic datasets and those most frequently targeted in real-world settings. We argue that poor model performance makes public models ill-suited for automatic hate speech moderation and find that high moderation rates are only achievable with substantial human oversight. Our results underscore the need to evaluate detection systems on data that reflects the complexity and diversity of real-world social media.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15462v3

We conduct large-scale training sweeps and careful parametric modeling of task performance to identify the inference compute-optimal frontier.

Steering into New Embedding Spaces: Analyzing Cross-Lingual Alignment Induced by Model Interventions in Multilingual Language Models,"['Anirudh Sundar', 'Sinead Williamson', 'Katherine Metcalf', 'Barry-John Theobald', 'Skyler Seto', 'Masha Fedzechkina']","Aligned representations across languages is a desired property in multilingual large language models (mLLMs), as alignment can improve performance in cross-lingual tasks. Typically alignment requires fine-tuning a model, which is computationally expensive, and sizable language data, which often may not be available. A data-efficient alternative to fine-tuning is model interventions -- a method for manipulating model activations to steer generation into the desired direction. We analyze the effect of a popular intervention (finding experts) on the alignment of cross-lingual representations in mLLMs. We identify the neurons to manipulate for a given language and introspect the embedding space of mLLMs pre- and post-manipulation. We show that modifying the mLLM's activations changes its embedding space such that cross-lingual alignment is enhanced. Further, we show that the changes to the embedding space translate into improved downstream performance on retrieval tasks, with up to 2x improvements in top-1 accuracy on cross-lingual retrieval.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15639v1

While large conversational models may be tricked into answering psychometric questionnaires, the latent psychological constructs of thousands of simpler transformers, trained for other tasks, cannot be assessed because appropriate psychometric methods are currently lacking. Here, we show how standard psychological questionnaires can be reformulated into natural language inference prompts, and we provide a code library to support the psychometric assessment of arbitrary models. We demonstrate, using a sample of 88 publicly available models, the existence of human-like mental health-related constructs (including anxiety, depression, and Sense of Coherence) which conform with standard theories in human psychology and show similar correlations and mitigation strategies.

Did Translation Models Get More Robust Without Anyone Even Noticing?,"['Ben Peters', 'Andre Martins']","Neural machine translation (MT) models achieve strong results across a variety of settings, but it is widely believed that they are highly sensitive to ""noisy"" inputs, such as spelling errors, abbreviations, and other formatting issues. In this paper, we revisit this insight in light of recent multilingual MT models and large language models (LLMs) applied to machine translation. Somewhat surprisingly, we show through controlled experiments that these models are far more robust to many kinds of noise than previous models, even when they perform similarly on clean data. This is notable because, even though LLMs have more parameters and more complex training processes than past models, none of the open ones we consider use any techniques specifically designed to encourage robustness. Next, we show that similar trends hold for social media translation experiments -- LLMs are more robust to social media text. We include an analysis of the circumstances in which source correction techniques can be used to mitigate the effects of noise. Altogether, we show that robustness to many types of noise has increased.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03923v1

By training on these challenging and realistic pairs, our approach ensures robust and stable contrastive optimization.

"Prompt Candidates, then Distill: A Teacher-Student Framework for LLM-driven Data Annotation","['Mingxuan Xia', 'Haobo Wang', 'Yixuan Li', 'Zewei Yu', 'Jindong Wang', 'Junbo Zhao', 'Runze Wu']","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for data annotation, markedly reducing the labor costs associated with downstream applications. However, existing methods mostly adopt an aggressive strategy by prompting LLM to determine a single gold label for each unlabeled sample. Due to the inherent uncertainty within LLMs, they often produce incorrect labels for difficult samples, severely compromising the data quality for downstream applications. Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring uncertainty. To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations with a Small Language Model (SLM). We further provide a rigorous justification demonstrating that distilling candidate annotations from the teacher LLM offers superior theoretical guarantees compared to directly using single annotations. Extensive experiments across six text classification tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

BQA: Body Language Question Answering Dataset for Video Large Language Models,"['Shintaro Ozaki', 'Kazuki Hayashi', 'Miyu Oba', 'Yusuke Sakai', 'Hidetaka Kamigaito', 'Taro Watanabe']","A large part of human communication relies on nonverbal cues such as facial expressions, eye contact, and body language. Unlike language or sign language, such nonverbal communication lacks formal rules, requiring complex reasoning based on commonsense understanding. Enabling current Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) to accurately interpret body language is a crucial challenge, as human unconscious actions can easily cause the model to misinterpret their intent. To address this, we propose a dataset, BQA, a body language question answering dataset, to validate whether the model can correctly interpret emotions from short clips of body language comprising 26 emotion labels of videos of body language. We evaluated various VideoLLMs on BQA and revealed that understanding body language is challenging, and our analyses of the wrong answers by VideoLLMs show that certain VideoLLMs made significantly biased answers depending on the age group and ethnicity of the individuals in the video. The dataset is available.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13206v2

Position-aware Automatic Circuit Discovery,"['Tal Haklay', 'Hadas Orgad', 'David Bau', 'Aaron Mueller', 'Yonatan Belinkov']","A widely used strategy to discover and understand language model mechanisms is circuit analysis. A circuit is a minimal subgraph of a model's computation graph that executes a specific task. We identify a gap in existing circuit discovery methods: they assume circuits are position-invariant, treating model components as equally relevant across input positions. This limits their ability to capture cross-positional interactions or mechanisms that vary across positions. To address this gap, we propose two improvements to incorporate positionality into circuits, even on tasks containing variable-length examples. First, we extend edge attribution patching, a gradient-based method for circuit discovery, to differentiate between token positions. Second, we introduce the concept of a dataset schema, which defines token spans with similar semantics across examples, enabling position-aware circuit discovery in datasets with variable length examples. We additionally develop an automated pipeline for schema generation and application using large language models. Our approach enables fully automated discovery of position-sensitive circuits, yielding better trade-offs between circuit size and faithfulness compared to prior work.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04577v1

Centurio: On Drivers of Multilingual Ability of Large Vision-Language Model,"['Gregor Geigle', 'Florian Schneider', 'Carolin Holtermann', 'Chris Biemann', 'Radu Timofte', 'Anne Lauscher', 'Goran Glavaš']","Most Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to date are trained predominantly on English data, which makes them struggle to understand non-English input and fail to generate output in the desired target language. Existing efforts mitigate these issues by adding multilingual training data, but do so in a largely ad-hoc manner, lacking insight into how different training mixes tip the scale for different groups of languages. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the training strategies for massively multilingual LVLMs. First, we conduct a series of multi-stage experiments spanning 13 downstream vision-language tasks and 43 languages, systematically examining: (1) the number of training languages that can be included without degrading English performance and (2) optimal language distributions of pre-training as well as (3) instruction-tuning data. Further, we (4) investigate how to improve multilingual text-in-image understanding, and introduce a new benchmark for the task. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that one can (i) include as many as 100 training languages simultaneously (ii) with as little as 25-50\% of non-English data, to greatly improve multilingual performance while retaining strong English performance. We further find that (iii) including non-English OCR data in pre-training and instruction-tuning is paramount for improving multilingual text-in-image understanding. Finally, we put all our findings together and train Centurio, a 100-language LVLM, offering state-of-the-art performance in an evaluation covering 14 tasks and 56 languages.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05122v1

Focusing on molecule caption generation, we explore post-training synergies between alignment fine-tuning and model merging in a cross-modal setup. We reveal intriguing insights into the behaviour and suitability of such methods while significantly surpassing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, we propose a novel atomic-level evaluation method leveraging off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) models for use in the unseen chemical domain.

Ensemble Watermarks for Large Language Models,"['Georg Niess', 'Roman Kern']","As large language models (LLMs) reach human-like fluency, reliably distinguishing AI-generated text from human authorship becomes increasingly difficult. While watermarks already exist for LLMs, they often lack flexibility and struggle with attacks such as paraphrasing. To address these issues, we propose a multi-feature method for generating watermarks that combines multiple distinct watermark features into an ensemble watermark. Concretely, we combine acrostica and sensorimotor norms with the established red-green watermark to achieve a 98% detection rate. After a paraphrasing attack, the performance remains high with 95% detection rate. In comparison, the red-green feature alone as a baseline achieves a detection rate of 49% after paraphrasing. The evaluation of all feature combinations reveals that the ensemble of all three consistently has the highest detection rate across several LLMs and watermark strength settings. Due to the flexibility of combining features in the ensemble, various requirements and trade-offs can be addressed. Additionally, the same detection function can be used without adaptations for all ensemble configurations. This method is particularly of interest to facilitate accountability and prevent societal harm.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19563v2

TRACT: Regression-Aware Fine-tuning Meets Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for LLM-as-a-Judge,"['Cheng-Han Chiang', 'Hung-yi Lee', 'Michal Lukasik']","The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm uses large language models (LLMs) for automated text evaluation, where a numerical assessment is assigned by an LLM to the input text following scoring rubrics. Existing methods for LLM-as-a-judge use cross-entropy (CE) loss for fine-tuning, which neglects the numeric nature of score prediction. Recent work addresses numerical prediction limitations of LLM fine-tuning through regression-aware fine-tuning, which, however, does not consider chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for score prediction. In this paper, we introduce TRACT (Two-stage Regression-Aware fine-tuning with CoT), a method combining CoT reasoning with regression-aware training. TRACT consists of two stages: first, seed LLM is fine-tuned to generate CoTs, which serve as supervision for the second stage fine-tuning. The training objective of TRACT combines the CE loss for learning the CoT reasoning capabilities, and the regression-aware loss for the score prediction. Experiments across four LLM-as-a-judge datasets and two LLMs show that TRACT significantly outperforms existing methods.

To address these limitations, we propose an innovative dynamic RAG method, DioR (Adaptive Cognitive Detection and Contextual Retrieval Optimization), which consists of two main components: adaptive cognitive detection and contextual retrieval optimization, specifically designed to determine when retrieval is needed and what to retrieve for LLMs is useful. Experimental results demonstrate that DioR achieves superior performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our work.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10198v2

However, high estimated probability does not always lead to high translation quality. Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding offers an alternative by seeking hypotheses with the highest expected utility. Inspired by Quality Estimation (QE) reranking which uses the QE model as a ranker we propose source-based MBR (sMBR) decoding, a novel approach that utilizes quasi-sources (generated via paraphrasing or back-translation) as ``support hypotheses'' and a reference-free quality estimation metric as the utility function, marking the first work to solely use sources in MBR decoding. Experiments show that sMBR outperforms QE reranking and the standard MBR decoding. Our findings suggest that sMBR is a promising approach for NMT decoding.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11632v5

Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches typically assume that users' query fully captures their real motivation. However, our analysis of a real-world e-commerce platform reveals that users often engage in relevant consultations before searching, indicating they refine intents through consultations based on motivation and need. The implied motivation in consultations is a key enhancing factor for personalized search. This unexplored area comes with new challenges including aligning contextual motivations with concise queries, bridging the category-text gap, and filtering noise within sequence history. To address these, we propose a Motivation-Aware Personalized Search (MAPS) method. It embeds queries and consultations into a unified semantic space via LLMs, utilizes a Mixture of Attention Experts (MoAE) to prioritize critical semantics, and introduces dual alignment: (1) contrastive learning aligns consultations, reviews, and product features; (2) bidirectional attention integrates motivation-aware embeddings with user preferences. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show MAPS outperforms existing methods in both retrieval and ranking tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01711v4
Aristotle: Mastering Logical Reasoning with A Logic-Complete Decompose-Search-Resolve Framework,"['Jundong Xu', 'Hao Fei', 'Meng Luo', 'Qian Liu', 'Liangming Pan', 'William Yang Wang', 'Preslav Nakov', 'Mong-Li Lee', 'Wynne Hsu']","In the context of large language models (LLMs), current advanced reasoning methods have made impressive strides in various reasoning tasks. However, when it comes to logical reasoning tasks, major challenges remain in both efficacy and efficiency. This is rooted in the fact that these systems fail to fully leverage the inherent structure of logical tasks throughout the reasoning processes such as decomposition, search, and resolution. To address this, we propose a logic-complete reasoning framework, Aristotle, with three key components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver. In our framework, symbolic expressions and logical rules are comprehensively integrated into the entire reasoning process, significantly alleviating the bottlenecks of logical reasoning, i.e., reducing sub-task complexity, minimizing search errors, and resolving logical contradictions. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that Aristotle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning frameworks in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly excelling in complex logical reasoning scenarios.

LADM: Long-context Training Data Selection with Attention-based Dependency Measurement for LLMs,"['Jianghao Chen', 'Junhong Wu', 'Yangyifan Xu', 'Jiajun Zhang']","Long-context modeling has drawn more and more attention in the area of Large Language Models (LLMs). Continual training with long-context data becomes the de-facto method to equip LLMs with the ability to process long inputs. However, it still remains an open challenge to measure the quality of long-context training data. To address this issue, we propose a Long-context data selection framework with Attention-based Dependency Measurement (LADM), which can efficiently identify high-quality long-context data from a large-scale, multi-domain pre-training corpus. LADM leverages the retrieval capabilities of the attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies, ensuring a comprehensive quality measurement of long-context data.

Iron Sharpens Iron: Defending Against Attacks in Machine-Generated Text Detection with Adversarial Training,"['Yuanfan Li', 'Zhaohan Zhang', 'Chengzhengxu Li', 'Chao Shen', 'Xiaoming Liu']","Machine-generated Text (MGT) detection is crucial for regulating and attributing online texts. While the existing MGT detectors achieve strong performance, they remain vulnerable to simple perturbations and adversarial attacks. To build an effective defense against malicious perturbations, we view MGT detection from a threat modeling perspective, that is, analyzing the model's vulnerability from an adversary's point of view and exploring effective mitigations. To this end, we introduce an adversarial framework for training a robust MGT detector, named GREedy Adversary PromoTed DefendER (GREATER). The GREATER consists of two key components: an adversary GREATER-A and a detector GREATER-D. The GREATER-D learns to defend against the adversarial attack from GREATER-A and generalizes the defense to other attacks. GREATER-A identifies and perturbs the critical tokens in embedding space, along with greedy search and pruning to generate stealthy and disruptive adversarial examples. Besides, we update the GREATER-A and GREATER-D synchronously, encouraging the GREATER-D to generalize its defense to different attacks and varying attack intensities. Our experimental results across 10 text perturbation strategies and 6 adversarial attacks show that our GREATER-D reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 0.67% compared with SOTA defense methods while our GREATER-A is demonstrated to be more effective and efficient than SOTA attack approaches.

The framework leverages simulated social interactions to generate conversations in which LLMs engage in role-playing within culturally adapted social scenarios, capturing implicit cultural norms for model fine-tuning. CLCA improves cultural value alignment across various model architectures measured using World Value Survey data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

We introduce a novel approach, Decoupled Refusal Training (DeRTa), designed to empower LLMs to refuse compliance to harmful prompts at any response position, significantly enhancing their safety capabilities. DeRTa incorporates two novel components: (1) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Harmful Response Prefix, which trains models to recognize and avoid unsafe content by appending a segment of harmful response to the beginning of a safe response, and (2) Reinforced Transition Optimization (RTO), which equips models with the ability to transition from potential harm to safety refusal consistently throughout the harmful response sequence.

Token Prepending: A Training-Free Approach for Eliciting Better Sentence Embeddings from LLMs,"['Yuchen Fu', 'Zifeng Cheng', 'Zhiwei Jiang', 'Zhonghui Wang', 'Yafeng Yin', 'Zhengliang Li', 'Qing Gu']","Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction, as LLMs have demonstrated stronger semantic understanding capabilities. Previous studies typically focus on prompt engineering to elicit sentence embeddings from LLMs by prompting the model to encode sentence information into the embedding of the last token. However, LLMs are mostly decoder-only models with causal attention and the earlier tokens in the sentence cannot attend to the latter tokens, resulting in biased encoding of sentence information and cascading effects on the final decoded token. To this end, we propose a novel Token Prepending (TP) technique that prepends each layer's decoded sentence embedding to the beginning of the sentence in the next layer's input, allowing earlier tokens to attend to the complete sentence information under the causal attention mechanism. The proposed TP technique is a plug-and-play and training-free technique, which means it can be seamlessly integrated with various prompt-based sentence embedding methods and autoregressive LLMs. Extensive experiments on various Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our proposed TP technique can significantly improve the performance of existing prompt-based sentence embedding methods across different LLMs, while incurring negligible additional inference cost.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11556v2

Addressing Blind Guessing: Calibration of Selection Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering by Video Language Models,"['Olga Loginova', 'Oleksandr Bezrukov', 'Ravi Shekhar', 'Alexey Kravets']","Evaluating Video Language Models (VLMs) is a challenging task. Due to its transparency, Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is widely used to measure the performance of these models through accuracy. However, existing MCQA benchmarks fail to capture the full reasoning capabilities of VLMs due to selection bias, when models disproportionately favor certain answer options based on positional patterns observed during training. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of several VLM architectures across major datasets designed to assess complex video-focused reasoning. We identify where the bias is most pronounced and demonstrate to what extent model responses reflect genuine understanding of video content and related questions, as opposed to reliance on arbitrary patterns or superficial cues, such as answer position. By decomposing the MCQA task and adapting fairness bias metrics to VLMs, we introduce a post-processing calibration technique BOLD to balance this bias. Our results show that reducing selection bias improves not only debiasing metrics but also overall model performance, including Accuracy and F1 Mean score. Our method, by suppressing ""blind guessing"", offers a more cost- and time-effective approach to mitigating selection bias compared to existing techniques. This study represents the first focused investigation of selection bias in video-to-text LLM-powered models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14248v2
Towards Reward Fairness in RLHF: From a Resource Allocation Perspective,"['Sheng Ouyang', 'Yulan Hu', 'Ge Chen', 'Qingyang Li', 'Fuzheng Zhang', 'Yong Liu']","Rewards serve as proxies for human preferences and play a crucial role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, if these rewards are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness reward model and a policy model, respectively. Experiments conducted in these scenarios demonstrate that our approach aligns LLMs with human preferences in a more fair manner.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23349v1

In the NLP literature, some assumptions about these dialects are widely adopted (e.g., ``Arabic dialects can be grouped into distinguishable regional dialects"") and are manifested in different computational tasks such as Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). However, these assumptions are not quantitatively verified. We identify four of these assumptions and examine them by extending and analyzing a multi-label dataset, where the validity of each sentence in 11 different country-level dialects is manually assessed by speakers of these dialects.

Retrieve to Explain: Evidence-driven Predictions for Explainable Drug Target Identification,"['Ravi Patel', 'Angus Brayne', 'Rogier Hintzen', 'Daniel Jaroslawicz', 'Georgiana Neculae', 'Dane S. Corneil']","Language models hold incredible promise for enabling scientific discovery by synthesizing massive research corpora. Many complex scientific research questions have multiple plausible answers, each supported by evidence of varying strength. However, existing language models lack the capability to quantitatively and faithfully compare answer plausibility in terms of supporting evidence. To address this, we introduce Retrieve to Explain (R2E), a retrieval-based model that scores and ranks all possible answers to a research question based on evidence retrieved from a document corpus. The architecture represents each answer only in terms of its supporting evidence, with the answer itself masked. This allows us to extend feature attribution methods such as Shapley values, to transparently attribute answer scores to supporting evidence at inference time. The architecture also allows incorporation of new evidence without retraining, including non-textual data modalities templated into natural language. We developed R2E for the challenging scientific discovery task of drug target identification, a human-in-the-loop process where failures are extremely costly and explainability paramount. When predicting whether drug targets will subsequently be confirmed as efficacious in clinical trials, R2E not only matches non-explainable literature-based models but also surpasses a genetics-based target identification approach used throughout the pharmaceutical industry.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04068v4

However, such preference data do not convey why users prefer responses that are chosen or rejected, so LLMs trained on these datasets cannot tailor responses to varied user needs. To surface these parameters of personalization, we apply abductive reasoning to preference data, inferring needs and interests of users, i.e., personas, that may prefer either response. We test this idea in two steps: Persona Inference (PI), abductively inferring personas of users who prefer chosen or rejected outputs, and Persona Tailoring (PT), training models to tailor outputs to personas from PI. We show: 1) LLMs infer personas accurately explaining why different users may prefer both chosen or rejected outputs; 2) Training on preference data augmented with PI personas via PT boosts personalization and generalizes to supporting user-written personas; and 3) Rejected response personas form harder personalization evaluations, showing PT better aids users with uncommon preferences versus typical alignment methods. We argue for an abductive view of preferences for personalization, asking not only which response is better but when, why, and for whom.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11549v2
Which of These Best Describes Multiple Choice Evaluation with LLMs?

We first reveal flaws in MCQA's format, as it struggles to: 1) test generation/subjectivity; 2) match LLM use cases; and 3) fully test knowledge. We instead advocate for generative formats based on human testing, where LLMs construct and explain answers, better capturing user needs and knowledge while remaining easy to score. We then show even when MCQA is a useful format, its datasets suffer from: leakage; unanswerability; shortcuts; and saturation. In each issue, we give fixes from education, like rubrics to guide MCQ writing; scoring methods to bridle guessing; and Item Response Theory to build harder MCQs. Lastly, we discuss LLM errors in MCQA, robustness, biases, and unfaithful explanations, showing how our prior solutions better measure or address these issues.

Moreover, current detectors primarily focus on binary classification and English texts, often overlooking the distinction between machine-generated true vs. fake news and the detection in low-resource languages. To this end, we updated detection schema to include machine-generated news with focus on the Urdu language.

However, existing Music AVQA methods often rely on dense and unoptimized representations, leading to inefficiencies in the isolation of key information, the reduction of redundancy, and the prioritization of critical samples. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparsify, a sparse learning framework specifically designed for Music AVQA. It integrates three sparsification strategies into an end-to-end pipeline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music AVQA datasets. In addition, it reduces training time by 28.32% compared to its fully trained dense counterpart while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating clear efficiency gains. To further improve data efficiency, we propose a key-subset selection algorithm that selects and uses approximately 25% of MUSIC-AVQA v2.0 training data and retains 70-80% of full-data performance across models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01319v1

Contrastive Prompting Enhances Sentence Embeddings in LLMs through Inference-Time Steering,"['Zifeng Cheng', 'Zhonghui Wang', 'Yuchen Fu', 'Zhiwei Jiang', 'Yafeng Yin', 'Cong Wang', 'Qing Gu']","Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a practical direction, as it requires neither additional data nor fine-tuning. Previous studies usually focus on prompt engineering to guide LLMs to encode the core semantic information of the sentence into the embedding of the last token. However, the last token in these methods still encodes an excess of non-essential information, such as stop words, limiting its encoding capacity. To this end, we propose a Contrastive Prompting (CP) method that introduces an extra auxiliary prompt to elicit better sentence embedding. By contrasting with the auxiliary prompt, CP can steer existing prompts to encode the core semantics of the sentence, rather than non-essential information. CP is a plug-and-play inference-time intervention method that can be combined with various prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our method can improve the performance of existing prompt-based methods across different LLMs. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zifengcheng/CP.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12831v1
Cracking the Code of Hallucination in LVLMs with Vision-aware Head Divergence,"['Jinghan He', 'Kuan Zhu', 'Haiyun Guo', 'Junfeng Fang', 'Zhenglin Hua', 'Yuheng Jia', 'Ming Tang', 'Tat-Seng Chua', 'Jinqiao Wang']","Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress in integrating large language models (LLMs) with visual inputs, enabling advanced multimodal reasoning. Despite their success, a persistent challenge is hallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual content-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on alignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at the generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an emphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce Vision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of attention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal the presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual information; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns is closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Vision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate hallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining high efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13949v3

Experiments on seven QA datasets demonstrate that LongRefiner achieves competitive performance in various scenarios while using 10x fewer computational costs and latency compared to the best baseline. Further analysis validates that LongRefiner is scalable, efficient, and effective, providing practical insights for real-world long-text RAG applications.

Comparing Moral Values in Western English-speaking societies and LLMs with Word Associations,"['Chaoyi Xiang', 'Chunhua Liu', 'Simon De Deyne', 'Lea Frermann']","As the impact of large language models increases, understanding the moral values they reflect becomes ever more important. Assessing the nature of moral values as understood by these models via direct prompting is challenging due to potential leakage of human norms into model training data, and their sensitivity to prompt formulation. Instead, we propose to use word associations, which have been shown to reflect moral reasoning in humans, as low-level underlying representations to obtain a more robust picture of LLMs' moral reasoning. We study moral differences in associations from western English-speaking communities and LLMs trained predominantly on English data. First, we create a large dataset of LLM-generated word associations, resembling an existing data set of human word associations. Next, we propose a novel method to propagate moral values based on seed words derived from Moral Foundation Theory through the human and LLM-generated association graphs. Finally, we compare the resulting moral conceptualizations, highlighting detailed but systematic differences between moral values emerging from English speakers and LLM associations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19674v2

In this paper, we propose AR-MCTS, a universal framework designed to progressively improve the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs through Active Retrieval (AR) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our approach begins with the development of a unified retrieval module that retrieves key supporting insights for solving complex reasoning problems from a hybrid-modal retrieval corpus. To bridge the gap in automated multimodal reasoning verification, we employ the MCTS algorithm combined with an active retrieval mechanism, which enables the automatic generation of step-wise annotations. This strategy dynamically retrieves key insights for each reasoning step, moving beyond traditional beam search sampling to improve the diversity and reliability of the reasoning space. Additionally, we introduce a process reward model that aligns progressively to support the automatic verification of multimodal reasoning tasks. Experimental results across three complex multimodal reasoning benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the AR-MCTS framework in enhancing the performance of various multimodal models. Further analysis demonstrates that AR-MCTS can optimize sampling diversity and accuracy, yielding reliable multimodal reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14835v1
Pre-training Distillation for Large Language Models: A Design Space Exploration,"['Hao Peng', 'Xin Lv', 'Yushi Bai', 'Zijun Yao', 'Jiajie Zhang', 'Lei Hou', 'Juanzi Li']","Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. Previous work applying KD in the field of large language models (LLMs) typically focused on the post-training phase, where the student LLM learns directly from instructions and corresponding responses generated by the teacher model. In this paper, we extend KD to the pre-training phase of LLMs, named pre-training distillation (PD). We first conduct a preliminary experiment using GLM-4-9B as the teacher LLM to distill a 1.9B parameter student LLM, validating the effectiveness of PD. Considering the key impact factors of distillation, we systematically explore the design space of pre-training distillation across four aspects: logits processing, loss selection, scaling law, and offline or online logits. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space of pre-training distillation and find better configurations and interesting conclusions, such as larger student LLMs generally benefiting more from pre-training distillation, while a larger teacher LLM does not necessarily guarantee better results. We hope our exploration of the design space will inform future practices in pre-training distillation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16215v1

To ensure the breadth and the practicality, we collect data from nearly 100 highly educated individuals with diverse professional backgrounds. We employ both automated and manual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty, resulting in human experts achieving only 53.7% accuracy under a 15-minute time constraint. Our evaluation reveals that the best-performing model, when directly answers the questions, achieves only 50.1% accuracy.

Prior research has shown that a single LLM's concept representations can be captured as steering vectors (SVs), enabling the control of LLM behavior (e.g., towards generating harmful content). Our work takes a novel approach by exploring the intricate relationships between concept representations across different LLMs, drawing an intriguing parallel to Plato's Allegory of the Cave. In particular, we introduce a linear transformation method to bridge these representations and present three key findings: 1) Concept representations across different LLMs can be effectively aligned using simple linear transformations, enabling efficient cross-model transfer and behavioral control via SVs. 2) This linear transformation generalizes across concepts, facilitating alignment and control of SVs representing different concepts across LLMs. 3) A weak-to-strong transferability exists between LLM concept representations, whereby SVs extracted from smaller LLMs can effectively control the behavior of larger LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02009v2

In principle, reinforcement learning (RL) with appropriate reward signals can further enhance models' capacities. However, how to obtain reliable rewards in long-context scenarios remains unexplored. To this end, we propose LongReward, a novel method that utilizes an off-the-shelf LLM to provide rewards for long-context model responses from four human-valued dimensions: helpfulness, logicality, faithfulness, and completeness, each with a carefully designed assessment pipeline. By combining LongReward and offline RL algorithm DPO, we are able to effectively improve long-context SFT models. Our experiments indicate that LongReward not only significantly improves models' long-context performance but also enhances their ability to follow short instructions.

"Influences on LLM Calibration: A Study of Response Agreement, Loss Functions, and Prompt Styles","['Yuxi Xia', 'Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo', 'Klim Zaporojets', 'Benjamin Roth']","Calibration, the alignment between model confidence and prediction accuracy, is critical for the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). Existing works neglect to measure the generalization of their methods to other prompt styles and different sizes of LLMs. To address this, we define a controlled experimental setting covering 12 LLMs and four prompt styles. We additionally investigate if incorporating the response agreement of multiple LLMs and an appropriate loss function can improve calibration performance. Concretely, we build Calib-n, a novel framework that trains an auxiliary model for confidence estimation that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs to capture inter-model agreement. To optimize calibration, we integrate focal and AUC surrogate losses alongside binary cross-entropy. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate that both response agreement and focal loss improve calibration from baselines. We find that few-shot prompts are the most effective for auxiliary model-based methods, and auxiliary models demonstrate robust calibration performance across accuracy variations, outperforming LLMs' internal probabilities and verbalized confidences. These insights deepen the understanding of influence factors in LLM calibration, supporting their reliable deployment in diverse applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03991v1

To address this challenge, we introduce UTGenerator, an LLM-driven test case generator that automatically analyzes codebases and dependencies to generate test cases for real-world Python projects. Building on UTGenerator, we propose UTBoost, a comprehensive framework for test case augmentation. In our evaluation, we identified 36 task instances with insufficient test cases and uncovered 345 erroneous patches incorrectly labeled as passed in the original SWE Bench.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Patent-CE, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating patent claims. Patent-CE includes comparative claim evaluations annotated by patent experts, focusing on five key criteria: feature completeness, conceptual clarity, terminology consistency, logical linkage, and overall quality. Additionally, we propose PatClaimEval, a novel multi-dimensional evaluation method specifically designed for patent claims.

Fine-Tuning on Diverse Reasoning Chains Drives Within-Inference CoT Refinement in LLMs,"['Haritz Puerto', 'Tilek Chubakov', 'Xiaodan Zhu', 'Harish Tayyar Madabushi', 'Iryna Gurevych']","Requiring a large language model (LLM) to generate intermediary reasoning steps, known as Chain of Thought (CoT), has been shown to be an effective way of boosting performance. Previous approaches have focused on generating multiple independent CoTs, combining them through ensembling or other post-hoc strategies to enhance reasoning. In this work, we introduce a novel approach where LLMs are fine-tuned to generate a sequence of Diverse Chains of Thought (DCoT) within a single inference step, which is fundamentally different from prior work that primarily operate on parallel CoT generations. DCoT allows LLMs to gain the ability to perform within-inference refinement of reasoning chains without requiring external feedback. Through a rigorous set of experiments spanning a wide range of tasks that require various reasoning types, we show that fine-tuning on DCoT improves performance over the CoT baseline across model families and scales (1.3B to 70B). These improvements are particularly impactful for tasks with a large result state space, such as those involving numeric answers. Our work is also significant because both quantitative analyses and manual evaluations reveal the observed gains stem from the models' ability to refine an initial reasoning chain by generating a second, improved chain within the same inference step, demonstrating previously elusive self-improvement.

Establishing Trustworthy LLM Evaluation via Shortcut Neuron Analysis,"['Kejian Zhu', 'Shangqing Tu', 'Zhuoran Jin', 'Lei Hou', 'Juanzi Li', 'Jun Zhao']","The development of large language models (LLMs) depends on trustworthy evaluation. However, most current evaluations rely on public benchmarks, which are prone to data contamination issues that significantly compromise fairness. Previous researches have focused on constructing dynamic benchmarks to address contamination. However, continuously building new benchmarks is costly and cyclical. In this work, we aim to tackle contamination by analyzing the mechanisms of contaminated models themselves. Through our experiments, we discover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to parameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training. We further propose a novel method for identifying shortcut neurons through comparative and causal analysis. Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called shortcut neuron patching to suppress shortcut neurons. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination. Additionally, our evaluation results exhibit a strong linear correlation with MixEval, a recently released trustworthy benchmark, achieving a Spearman coefficient ($\rho$) exceeding 0.95. This high correlation indicates that our method closely reveals true capabilities of the models and is trustworthy. We conduct further experiments to demonstrate the generalizability of our method across various benchmarks and hyperparameter settings.

We propose Token Internal Position Awareness (TIPA), a method that significantly improves models' ability to capture character positions within tokens by training them on reverse character prediction tasks using the tokenizer's vocabulary. Experiments demonstrate that TIPA enhances position prediction accuracy in LLMs, enabling more precise identification of target characters in original text. Furthermore, when applied to downstream tasks that do not require exact position prediction, TIPA still boosts performance in tasks needing character-level information, validating its versatility and effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17679v5

We explore retrieval and generation methods for acquiring historical analogies based on different large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, we propose a self-reflection method to mitigate hallucinations and stereotypes when LLMs generate historical analogies.

Through a study of four non-Anglophonic cultures, we observe bidirectional cultural transfer between English and other high-resource languages, while low-resource languages primarily transfer knowledge to English with limited reverse flow. To explain this asymmetric phenomenon, we propose a frequency-based hypothesis: cultural knowledge appearing more frequently in the pretraining data transfers more easily, which is supported by empirical analysis of the training corpora.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01675v1
Read it in Two Steps: Translating Extremely Low-Resource Languages with Code-Augmented Grammar Books,"['Chen Zhang', 'Jiuheng Lin', 'Xiao Liu', 'Zekai Zhang', 'Yansong Feng']","While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in translating extremely low-resource languages using resources like dictionaries, the effectiveness of grammar books remains debated. This paper investigates the role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation. Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules significantly boosts both rule retrieval and application, ultimately resulting in a 13.1% BLEU improvement in translation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01796v1

To have a deeper understanding of self-correction, we endeavor to decompose, evaluate, and analyze the self-correction behaviors of LLMs. By enumerating and analyzing answer correctness before and after self-correction, we decompose the self-correction capability into confidence (being confident to correct answers) and critique (turning wrong answers to correct) capabilities, and propose two metrics from a probabilistic perspective to measure these 2 capabilities, along with another metric for overall self-correction capability evaluation. Based on our decomposition and evaluation metrics, we conduct extensive experiments and draw some empirical conclusions. For example, we find different models can exhibit distinct behaviors: some models are confident while others are more critical. We also find the trade-off between the two capabilities (i.e. improving one can lead to a decline in the other) when manipulating model self-correction behavior by prompts or in-context learning. Further, we find a simple yet efficient strategy to improve self-correction capability by transforming Supervision Fine-Tuning (SFT) data format, and our strategy outperforms vanilla SFT in both capabilities and achieves much higher accuracy after self-correction.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance.

TokAlign: Efficient Vocabulary Adaptation via Token Alignment,"['Chong Li', 'Jiajun Zhang', 'Chengqing Zong']","Tokenization serves as a foundational step for Large Language Models (LLMs) to process text. In new domains or languages, the inefficiency of the tokenizer will slow down the training and generation of LLM. The mismatch in vocabulary also hinders deep knowledge transfer between LLMs like token-level distillation. To mitigate this gap, we propose an efficient method named TokAlign to replace the vocabulary of LLM from the token co-occurrences view, and further transfer the token-level knowledge between models. It first aligns the source vocabulary to the target one by learning a one-to-one mapping matrix for token IDs. Model parameters, including embeddings, are rearranged and progressively fine-tuned for the new vocabulary. Our method significantly improves multilingual text compression rates and vocabulary initialization for LLMs, decreasing the perplexity from 3.4$\text{e}^2$ of strong baseline methods to 1.2$\text{e}^2$ after initialization. Experimental results on models across multiple parameter scales demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of TokAlign, which costs as few as 5k steps to restore the performance of the vanilla model.

The Impact of Token Granularity on the Predictive Power of Language Model Surprisal,"['Byung-Doh Oh', 'William Schuler']","Word-by-word language model surprisal is often used to model the incremental processing of human readers, which raises questions about how various choices in language modeling influence its predictive power. One factor that has been overlooked in cognitive modeling is the granularity of subword tokens, which explicitly encodes information about word length and frequency, and ultimately influences the quality of vector representations that are learned. This paper presents experiments that manipulate the token granularity and evaluate its impact on the ability of surprisal to account for processing difficulty of naturalistic text and garden-path constructions. Experiments with naturalistic reading times reveal a substantial influence of token granularity on surprisal, with tokens defined by a vocabulary size of 8,000 resulting in surprisal that is most predictive. In contrast, on garden-path constructions, language models trained on coarser-grained tokens generally assigned higher surprisal to critical regions, suggesting a greater sensitivity to garden-path effects than previously reported. Taken together, these results suggest a large role of token granularity on the quality of language model surprisal for cognitive modeling.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11940v2
Segment-Level Diffusion: A Framework for Controllable Long-Form Generation with Diffusion Language Models,"['Xiaochen Zhu', 'Georgi Karadzhov', 'Chenxi Whitehouse', 'Andreas Vlachos']","Diffusion models have shown promise in text generation, but often struggle with generating long, coherent, and contextually accurate text. Token-level diffusion doesn't model word-order dependencies explicitly and operates on short, fixed output windows, while passage-level diffusion struggles with learning robust representations for long-form text. To address these challenges, we propose Segment-Level Diffusion (SLD), a framework that enhances diffusion-based text generation through text segmentation, robust representation training with adversarial and contrastive learning, and improved latent-space guidance. By segmenting long-form outputs into multiple latent representations and decoding them with an autoregressive decoder, SLD simplifies diffusion predictions and improves scalability. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that, when compared to other diffusion and autoregressive baselines SLD achieves competitive or superior fluency, coherence, and contextual compatibility in automatic and human evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11333v2
BELLE: A Bi-Level Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework for Multi-Hop Question Answering,"['Taolin Zhang', 'Dongyang Li', 'Qizhou Chen', 'Chengyu Wang', 'Xiaofeng He']","Multi-hop question answering (QA) involves finding multiple relevant passages and performing step-by-step reasoning to answer complex questions. Previous works on multi-hop QA employ specific methods from different modeling perspectives based on large language models (LLMs), regardless of the question types. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of public multi-hop QA benchmarks, dividing the questions into four types and evaluating five types of cutting-edge methods for multi-hop QA: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Single-step, Iterative-step, Sub-step, and Adaptive-step. We find that different types of multi-hop questions have varying degrees of sensitivity to different types of methods. Thus, we propose a Bi-levEL muLti-agEnt reasoning (BELLE) framework to address multi-hop QA by specifically focusing on the correspondence between question types and methods, where each type of method is regarded as an ''operator'' by prompting LLMs differently. The first level of BELLE includes multiple agents that debate to obtain an executive plan of combined ''operators'' to address the multi-hop QA task comprehensively. During the debate, in addition to the basic roles of affirmative debater, negative debater, and judge, at the second level, we further leverage fast and slow debaters to monitor whether changes in viewpoints are reasonable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BELLE significantly outperforms strong baselines in various datasets. Additionally, the model consumption of BELLE is higher cost-effectiveness than that of single models in more complex multi-hop QA scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11811v1

To address this, we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples, thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness.

In this work, we introduce the text-image interleaved retrieval (TIIR) task, where the query and document are interleaved text-image sequences, and the model is required to understand the semantics from the interleaved context for effective retrieval. We construct a TIIR benchmark based on naturally interleaved wikiHow tutorials, where a specific pipeline is designed to generate interleaved queries. To explore the task, we adapt several off-the-shelf retrievers and build a dense baseline by interleaved multimodal large language model (MLLM). We then propose a novel Matryoshka Multimodal Embedder (MME), which compresses the number of visual tokens at different granularity, to address the challenge of excessive visual tokens in MLLM-based TIIR models. Experiments demonstrate that simple adaption of existing models does not consistently yield effective results. Our MME achieves significant improvements over the baseline by substantially fewer visual tokens.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a framework called EpicPRM, which annotates each intermediate reasoning step based on its quantified contribution and uses an adaptive binary search algorithm to enhance both annotation precision and efficiency.

Game Development as Human-LLM Interaction,"['Jiale Hong', 'Hongqiu Wu', 'hai zhao']","Game development is a highly specialized task that relies on a complex game engine powered by complex programming languages, preventing many gaming enthusiasts from handling it. This paper introduces the Chat Game Engine (ChatGE) powered by LLM, which allows everyone to develop a custom game using natural language through Human-LLM interaction. To enable an LLM to function as a ChatGE, we instruct it to perform the following processes in each turn: (1) $P_{script}$: configure the game script segment based on the user's input; (2) $P_{code}$: generate the corresponding code snippet based on the game script segment; (3) $P_{utter}$: interact with the user, including guidance and feedback. We propose a data synthesis pipeline based on LLM to generate game script-code pairs and interactions from a few manually crafted seed data. We propose a three-stage progressive training strategy to transfer the dialogue-based LLM to our ChatGE smoothly. We construct a ChatGE for poker games as a case study and comprehensively evaluate it from two perspectives: interaction quality and code correctness.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09386v2

Our analysis examines L1-driven linguistic biases, such as reference word usage and avoidance behaviors, using information-theoretic and distributional density measures. Results show that modern LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLAMA3.3, DeepseekV3, GPT-4o) replicate L1-dependent patterns observed in human L2 data, with distinct influences from various languages (e.g., Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin significantly affect tense agreement, and Urdu influences noun-verb collocations).

Using an empirically documented asymmetry between pronoun production and interpretation in humans for implicit causality verbs as a testbed, we find that some LLMs do quantitatively and qualitatively reflect human-like asymmetries between production and interpretation. We demonstrate that whether this behavior holds depends upon both model size-with larger models more likely to reflect human-like patterns and the choice of meta-linguistic prompts used to elicit the behavior.

Currently, static benchmarks suffer from inflexibility and unreliability, leading users to prefer human voting platforms like Chatbot Arena. However, human evaluations require significant manual effort. To address this, we propose the Auto-Arena, an innovative framework that automates the entire evaluation process using LLM-powered agents. Firstly, an LLM examiner generates questions. Then, two LLM candidates engage in a multi-round peer battle based on individual questions, aiming at revealing their true performance differences. Finally, a committee of LLM judges collaboratively discusses and decides the winner, reducing bias and enhancing fairness. During the peer battles, we observe intriguing scenarios where the LLM candidates display competitive behaviors and even learn from the opponents. In our extensive experiments involving 15 recent LLMs, Auto-Arena shows a 92.14% correlation with human preferences, surpassing all previous expert-annotated benchmarks without any manual efforts. As a result, Auto-Arena offers a promising alternative to current human evaluation platforms for evaluating LLMs automatically.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20267v4

PTQ1.61: Push the Real Limit of Extremely Low-Bit Post-Training Quantization Methods for Large Language Models,"['Jiaqi Zhao', 'Miao Zhang', 'Ming Wang', 'Yuzhang Shang', 'Kaihao Zhang', 'Weili Guan', 'Yaowei Wang', 'Min Zhang']","Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer severe performance degradation when facing extremely low-bit (sub 2-bit) quantization. Several existing sub 2-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) methods utilize a mix-precision scheme by leveraging an unstructured fine-grained mask to explicitly distinguish salient weights, while which introduces an extra 1-bit or more per weight. To explore the real limit of PTQ, we propose an extremely low-bit PTQ method called PTQ1.61, which enables weight quantization to 1.61-bit for the first time. Specifically, we first introduce a one-dimensional structured mask with negligibly additional 0.0002-bit per weight based on input activations from the perspective of reducing the upper bound of quantization error to allocate corresponding salient weight channels to 4-bit. For non-salient channels binarization, an efficient block-wise scaling factors optimization framework is then presented to take implicit row-wise correlations and angular biases into account. Different from prior works that concentrate on adjusting quantization methodologies, we further propose a novel paradigm called quantization preprocessing, where we argue that transforming the weight distribution of the pretrained model before quantization can alleviate the difficulty in per-channel extremely low-bit PTQ. Extensive experiments indicate our PTQ1.61 achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization.

However, these methods often face challenges such as superposition and layer-wise activation variance, which limit their reliability. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) offer a more nuanced analysis by decomposing the activations of LLMs into a sparse linear combination of SAE features. We introduce a novel metric to assess the monolinguality of features obtained from SAEs, discovering that some features are strongly related to specific languages. Additionally, we show that ablating these SAE features only significantly reduces abilities in one language of LLMs, leaving others almost unaffected. Interestingly, we find some languages have multiple synergistic SAE features, and ablating them together yields greater improvement than ablating individually. Moreover, we leverage these SAE-derived language-specific features to enhance steering vectors, achieving control over the language generated by LLMs. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Aatrox103/multilingual-llm-features.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05111v2

In this paper, we introduce a benchmark named SafeRAG designed to evaluate the RAG security. First, we classify attack tasks into silver noise, inter-context conflict, soft ad, and white Denial-of-Service. Next, we construct RAG security evaluation dataset (i.e., SafeRAG dataset) primarily manually for each task. We then utilize the SafeRAG dataset to simulate various attack scenarios that RAG may encounter.

While successors like QwQ, Deepseek-R1 (R1) and LIMO replicate these advancements, whether these models truly possess test-time scaling capabilities remains underexplored. This study found that longer CoTs of these o1-like models do not consistently enhance accuracy; in fact, correct solutions are often shorter than incorrect ones for the same questions. Further investigation shows this phenomenon is closely related to models' self-revision capabilities - longer CoTs contain more self-revisions, which often lead to performance degradation. We then compare sequential and parallel scaling strategies on QwQ, R1 and LIMO, finding that parallel scaling achieves better coverage and scalability. Based on these insights, we propose Shortest Majority Vote, a method that combines parallel scaling strategies with CoT length characteristics, significantly improving models' test-time scalability compared to conventional majority voting approaches.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12215v2

Concurrently, the safety of such generative models has become an area of growing concern. This work introduces a novel type of jailbreak, which triggers T2I models to generate the image with visual text, where the image and the text, although considered to be safe in isolation, combine to form unsafe content. To systematically explore this phenomenon, we propose a dataset to evaluate the current diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models under such jailbreak. We benchmark nine representative T2I models, including two closed-source commercial models. Experimental results reveal a concerning tendency to produce unsafe content: all tested models suffer from such type of jailbreak, with rates of unsafe generation ranging from around 10\% to 70\% where DALLE 3 demonstrates almost the highest unsafety. In real-world scenarios, various filters such as keyword blocklists, customized prompt filters, and NSFW image filters, are commonly employed to mitigate these risks. We evaluate the effectiveness of such filters against our jailbreak and found that, while these filters may be effective for single modality detection, they fail to work against our jailbreak. We also investigate the underlying reason for such jailbreaks, from the perspective of text rendering capability and training data.

This paper develops a unified theoretical framework for understanding the generalization behaviors of transformers in arithmetic tasks, focusing on length generalization. Through detailed analysis of addition, multiplication, and modular operations, we reveal that translation invariance in addition aligns with relative positional encoding for robust generalization, while base mismatch in modular operations disrupts this alignment.

This progression not only underscores the potential of LALMs but also broadens their applicability across a wide range of practical scenarios supported by audio dialogues. However, given these advancements, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of LALMs in the open-ended audio dialogue understanding remains absent currently. To address this gap, we propose an Audio Dialogue Understanding Benchmark (ADU-Bench), which consists of 4 benchmark datasets. They assess the open-ended audio dialogue ability for LALMs in 3 general scenarios, 12 skills, 9 multilingual languages, and 4 categories of ambiguity handling. Notably, we firstly propose the evaluation of ambiguity handling in audio dialogues that expresses different intentions beyond the same literal meaning of sentences, e.g., ""Really!?"" with different intonations. In summary, ADU-Bench includes over 20,000 open-ended audio dialogues for the assessment of LALMs. Through extensive experiments conducted on 13 LALMs, our analysis reveals that there is still considerable room for improvement in the audio dialogue understanding abilities of existing LALMs. In particular, they struggle with mathematical symbols and formulas, understanding human behavior such as roleplay, comprehending multiple languages, and handling audio dialogue ambiguities from different phonetic elements, such as intonations, pause positions, and homophones.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05167v1

In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits AdVersArial meTAphoR (AVATAR) to induce the LLM to calibrate malicious metaphors for jailbreaking. Specifically, to answer harmful queries, AVATAR adaptively identifies a set of benign but logically related metaphors as the initial seed. Then, driven by these metaphors, the target LLM is induced to reason and calibrate about the metaphorical content, thus jailbroken by either directly outputting harmful responses or calibrating residuals between metaphorical and professional harmful content.

However, existing watermark methods often struggle with a fundamental dilemma: improving watermark effectiveness (the detectability of the watermark) often comes at the cost of reduced text quality. This trade-off limits their practical application. To address this challenge, we first formalize the problem within a multi-objective trade-off analysis framework. Within this framework, we identify a key factor that influences the dilemma. Unlike existing methods, where watermark strength is typically treated as a fixed hyperparameter, our theoretical insights lead to the development of MorphMarka method that adaptively adjusts the watermark strength in response to changes in the identified factor, thereby achieving an effective resolution of the dilemma. In addition, MorphMark also prioritizes flexibility since it is a model-agnostic and model-free watermark method, thereby offering a practical solution for real-world deployment, particularly in light of the rapid evolution of AI models.

Through extensive experiments, we show that while gist-based compression can achieve near-lossless performance on tasks like retrieval-augmented generation and long-document QA, it faces challenges in tasks like synthetic recall. Furthermore, we identify three key failure patterns: lost by the boundary, lost if surprise, and lost along the way. To mitigate these issues, we propose two effective strategies: fine-grained autoencoding, which enhances the reconstruction of original token information, and segment-wise token importance estimation, which adjusts optimization based on token dependencies.

On the Limit of Language Models as Planning Formalizers,"['Cassie Huang', 'Li Zhang']","Large Language Models have been found to create plans that are neither executable nor verifiable in grounded environments. An emerging line of work demonstrates success in using the LLM as a formalizer to generate a formal representation of the planning domain in some language, such as Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). This formal representation can be deterministically solved to find a plan. We systematically evaluate this methodology while bridging some major gaps. While previous work only generates a partial PDDL representation, given templated, and therefore unrealistic environment descriptions, we generate the complete representation given descriptions of various naturalness levels. Among an array of observations critical to improve LLMs' formal planning abilities, we note that most large enough models can effectively formalize descriptions as PDDL, outperforming those directly generating plans, while being robust to lexical perturbation. As the descriptions become more natural-sounding, we observe a decrease in performance and provide detailed error analysis.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09879v4

Enhancing Unsupervised Sentence Embeddings via Knowledge-Driven Data Augmentation and Gaussian-Decayed Contrastive Learning,"['Peichao Lai', 'Zhengfeng Zhang', 'Wentao Zhang', 'Fangcheng Fu', 'Bin CUI']","Recently, using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has led to considerable improvements in unsupervised sentence embedding models. However, existing methods encounter two primary challenges: limited data diversity and high data noise. Current approaches often neglect fine-grained knowledge, such as entities and quantities, leading to insufficient diversity. Besides, unsupervised data frequently lacks discriminative information, and the generated synthetic samples may introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline-based data augmentation method via LLMs and introduce the Gaussian-decayed gradient-assisted Contrastive Sentence Embedding (GCSE) model to enhance unsupervised sentence embeddings. To tackle the issue of low data diversity, our pipeline utilizes knowledge graphs (KGs) to extract entities and quantities, enabling LLMs to generate more diverse samples. To address high data noise, the GCSE model uses a Gaussian-decayed function to limit the impact of false hard negative samples, enhancing the model's discriminative capability. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, using fewer data samples and smaller LLMs, demonstrating its efficiency and robustness across various models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12887v3

To address this, current methods often design various data flywheels to collect complex code instructions, enabling models to handle more intricate tasks. However, these approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf datasets and data augmentation from a limited set of proprietary LLMs (e.g., Claude, GPT4, and so on), which restricts the diversity of the constructed data and makes it prone to systemic biases. In this paper, we propose WarriorCoder, a novel paradigm learns from expert battles to address these limitations. Specifically, we create an arena where leading expert code LLMs challenge each other, with evaluations conducted by impartial judges. This competitive framework generates novel training data from scratch, leveraging the strengths of all participants. Experimental results show that WarriorCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous models of the same size, even without relying on proprietary LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17395v3

However, distillation can lead to model homogenization, reducing diversity among models and impairing their ability to robustly handle complex or novel tasks. These limitations underscore the need to systematically quantify the distillation process and its impact. In this work, we propose a framework to evaluate and quantify model distillation. Our method addresses two key aspects: (1) Identifying identity cognition contradictions to assess discrepancies in how models perceive and represent identity-related information, and (2) Analyzing multi-granularity response similarities across models to measure the extent of homogenization. Experimental results demonstrate two key insights: (1) Well-known closed-source and open-source LLMs usually exhibit high distillation degrees, except for Claude, Doubao, and Gemini. (2) Base LLMs show higher distillation degrees compared to aligned LLMs. By offering a systematic approach to improve the transparency of LLM data distillation, we call for LLMs with more independent development and more transparent technical reports to improve LLMs' robustness and safety.

Demons in the Detail: On Implementing Load Balancing Loss for Training Specialized Mixture-of-Expert Models,"['Zihan Qiu', 'Zeyu Huang', 'Bo Zheng', 'Kaiyue Wen', 'Zekun Wang', 'Rui Men', 'Ivan Titov', 'Dayiheng Liu', 'Jingren Zhou', 'Junyang Lin']","This paper revisits the implementation of $\textbf{L}$oad-$\textbf{b}$alancing $\textbf{L}$oss (LBL) when training Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) models. Specifically, LBL for MoEs is defined as $N_E \sum_{i=1}^{N_E} f_i p_i$, where $N_E$ is the total number of experts, $f_i$ represents the frequency of expert $i$ being selected, and $p_i$ denotes the average gating score of the expert $i$. Existing MoE training frameworks usually employ the parallel training strategy so that $f_i$ and the LBL are calculated within a $\textbf{micro-batch}$ and then averaged across parallel groups. In essence, a micro-batch for training billion-scale LLMs normally contains very few sequences. So, the micro-batch LBL is almost at the sequence level, and the router is pushed to distribute the token evenly within each sequence. Under this strict constraint, even tokens from a domain-specific sequence ($\textit{e.g.}$, code) are uniformly routed to all experts, thereby inhibiting expert specialization. In this work, we propose calculating LBL using a $\textbf{global-batch}$ to loose this constraint. Because a global-batch contains much more diverse sequences than a micro-batch, which will encourage load balance at the corpus level. Specifically, we introduce an extra communication step to synchronize $f_i$ across micro-batches and then use it to calculate the LBL. Through experiments on training MoEs-based LLMs (up to $\textbf{42.8B}$ total parameters and $\textbf{400B}$ tokens), we surprisingly find that the global-batch LBL strategy yields excellent performance gains in both pre-training perplexity and downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that the global-batch LBL also greatly improves the domain specialization of MoE experts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11873v2

However, its reliability is compromised by the CoT reasoning's inability to capture comprehensive and deeper details, often leading to incomplete outcomes. Existing methods mainly rely on majority voting or criteria expansion, which is insufficient to address the limitation in CoT. We propose Crowd-based Comparative Evaluation, which introduces additional crowd responses to compare with the candidate responses, thereby exposing deeper and more comprehensive details within the candidate responses. This process effectively guides LLM-as-a-Judge to provide a more detailed CoT judgment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances evaluation reliability, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.7% across five benchmarks. Moreover, our method produces higher-quality CoTs that facilitate judge distillation and exhibit superior performance in rejection sampling for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), referred to as crowd rejection sampling, thereby enabling more efficient SFT. Our analysis confirms that CoTs generated by ours are more comprehensive and of higher quality, and evaluation accuracy improves as inference scales.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12501v2
Lost in Multilinguality: Dissecting Cross-lingual Factual Inconsistency in Transformer Language Models,"['Mingyang Wang', 'Heike Adel', 'Lukas Lange', 'Yihong Liu', 'Ercong Nie', 'Jannik Strötgen', 'Hinrich Schuetze']","Multilingual language models (MLMs) store factual knowledge across languages but often struggle to provide consistent responses to semantically equivalent prompts in different languages. While previous studies point out this cross-lingual inconsistency issue, the underlying causes remain unexplored. In this work, we use mechanistic interpretability methods to investigate cross-lingual inconsistencies in MLMs. We find that MLMs encode knowledge in a language-independent concept space through most layers, and only transition to language-specific spaces in the final layers. Failures during the language transition often result in incorrect predictions in the target language, even when the answers are correct in other languages. To mitigate this inconsistency issue, we propose a linear shortcut method that bypasses computations in the final layers, enhancing both prediction accuracy and cross-lingual consistency. Our findings shed light on the internal mechanisms of MLMs and provide a lightweight, effective strategy for producing more consistent factual outputs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04264v1
Optimizing Decomposition for Optimal Claim Verification,"['Yining Lu', 'Noah Ziems', 'Hy Dang', 'Meng Jiang']","Current research on the \textit{Decompose-Then-Verify} paradigm for evaluating the factuality of long-form text typically treats decomposition and verification in isolation, overlooking their interactions and potential misalignment. We find that existing decomposition policies, typically hand-crafted demonstrations, do not align well with downstream verifiers in terms of atomicity -- a novel metric quantifying information density -- leading to suboptimal verification results. We formulate finding the optimal decomposition policy for optimal verification as a bilevel optimization problem. To approximate a solution for this strongly NP-hard problem, we propose dynamic decomposition, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn a policy for dynamically decomposing claims to verifier-preferred atomicity. Experimental results show that dynamic decomposition outperforms existing decomposition policies, improving verification confidence by 0.07 and accuracy by 0.12 (on a 0-1 scale) on average across varying verifiers, datasets, and atomcities of input claims.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15354v2

During our re-implementation of this model, we noticed that in multimodal tasks requiring visual input (e.g., geometry problems), Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) struggle to maintain focus on the visual information, in other words, MLLMs suffer from a gradual decline in attention to visual information as reasoning progresses, causing text-over-relied outputs. To investigate this, we ablate image inputs during long-chain reasoning. Concretely, we truncate the reasoning process midway, then re-complete the reasoning process with the input image removed. We observe only a ~2% accuracy drop on MathVista's test-hard subset, revealing the model's textual outputs dominate the following reasoning process. Motivated by this, we propose Take-along Visual Conditioning (TVC), a strategy that shifts image input to critical reasoning stages and compresses redundant visual tokens via dynamic pruning. This methodology helps the model retain attention to the visual components throughout the reasoning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks (+3.4 points vs previous sota), demonstrating the effectiveness of TVC in enhancing multimodal reasoning systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13360v2

This paper initially introduces a dual-metric evaluation method, comprising Boundary Clarity and Chunk Stickiness, to enable the direct quantification of chunking quality. Leveraging this assessment method, we highlight the inherent limitations of traditional and semantic chunking in handling complex contextual nuances, thereby substantiating the necessity of integrating LLMs into chunking process. To address the inherent trade-off between computational efficiency and chunking precision in LLM-based approaches, we devise the granularity-aware Mixture-of-Chunkers (MoC) framework, which consists of a three-stage processing mechanism. Notably, our objective is to guide the chunker towards generating a structured list of chunking regular expressions, which are subsequently employed to extract chunks from the original text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both our proposed metrics and the MoC framework effectively settle challenges of the chunking task, revealing the chunking kernel while enhancing the performance of the RAG system.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09600v2
Mitigating Selection Bias with Node Pruning and Auxiliary Options,"['Hyeong Kyu Choi', 'Weijie Xu', 'Chi Xue', 'Stephanie Eckman', 'Chandan K.

This bias reduces the accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs, limiting their usefulness in decision-critical applications. While prior work has focused on adjusting model inputs or outputs to mitigate this issue, our work takes a fundamentally different approach by identifying and removing the internal sources of bias. We introduce two methods: Bias Node Pruning (BNP), which prunes parameters that contribute to selection bias, and Auxiliary Option Injection (AOI), which introduces an additional answer choice to reduce bias in both white-box and black-box settings. To address the shortcomings of existing evaluation metrics, we propose Choice Kullback-Leibler Divergence (CKLD), a new metric that captures distributional imbalances in model predictions.

To this end, we introduce the Retrieval Preference Optimization (RPO), a lightweight and effective alignment method to adaptively leverage multi-source knowledge based on retrieval relevance. An implicit representation of retrieval relevance is derived and incorporated into the reward model to integrate retrieval evaluation and response generation into a single model, solving the problem that previous methods necessitate the additional procedure to assess the retrieval quality. Notably, RPO is the only RAG-dedicated alignment approach that quantifies the awareness of retrieval relevance in training, overcoming mathematical obstacles. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that RPO outperforms RAG by 4-10% in accuracy without any extra component, exhibiting its robust generalization.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13726v1

However, such benchmarks may overestimate true clinical understanding by rewarding pattern recognition and test-taking heuristics. To investigate this, we created a fictional medical benchmark centered on an imaginary organ, the Glianorex, allowing us to separate memorized knowledge from reasoning ability. We generated textbooks and MCQs in English and French using leading LLMs, then evaluated proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific models in a zero-shot setting. Despite the fictional content, models achieved an average score of 64%, while physicians scored only 27%. Fine-tuned medical models outperformed base models in English but not in French. Ablation and interpretability analyses revealed that models frequently relied on shallow cues, test-taking strategies, and hallucinated reasoning to identify the correct choice.

Our experiments show that annotators who frequently use LLMs for writing tasks excel at detecting AI-generated text, even without any specialized training or feedback. In fact, the majority vote among five such ""expert"" annotators misclassifies only 1 of 300 articles, significantly outperforming most commercial and open-source detectors we evaluated even in the presence of evasion tactics like paraphrasing and humanization. Qualitative analysis of the experts' free-form explanations shows that while they rely heavily on specific lexical clues ('AI vocabulary'), they also pick up on more complex phenomena within the text (e.g., formality, originality, clarity) that are challenging to assess for automatic detectors.

Bridging the Language Gaps in Large Language Models with Inference-Time Cross-Lingual Intervention,"['Weixuan Wang', 'Minghao Wu', 'Barry Haddow', 'Alexandra Birch']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing but exhibit significant performance gaps among different languages. Most existing approaches to address these disparities rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations without incurring significant costs, we propose Inference-Time Cross-Lingual Intervention (INCLINE), a novel framework that enhances LLM performance on low-performing (source) languages by aligning their internal representations with those of high-performing (target) languages during inference. INCLINE initially learns alignment matrices using parallel sentences from source and target languages through a Least-Squares optimization, and then applies these matrices during inference to transform the low-performing language representations toward the high-performing language space. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks with five LLMs demonstrate that INCLINE significantly improves performance across diverse tasks and languages, compared to recent strong baselines. Our analysis demonstrates that INCLINE is highly cost-effective and applicable to a wide range of applications.

We propose Agentic Long-Context Understanding (AgenticLU), a framework designed to enhance an LLM's understanding of such queries by integrating targeted self-clarification with contextual grounding within an agentic workflow. At the core of AgenticLU is Chain-of-Clarifications (CoC), where models refine their understanding through self-generated clarification questions and corresponding contextual groundings. By scaling inference as a tree search where each node represents a CoC step, we achieve 97.8% answer recall on NarrativeQA with a search depth of up to three and a branching factor of eight. To amortize the high cost of this search process to training, we leverage the preference pairs for each step obtained by the CoC workflow and perform two-stage model finetuning: (1) supervised finetuning to learn effective decomposition strategies, and (2) direct preference optimization to enhance reasoning quality. This enables AgenticLU models to generate clarifications and retrieve relevant context effectively and efficiently in a single inference pass. Extensive experiments across seven long-context tasks demonstrate that AgenticLU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods and specialized long-context LLMs, achieving robust multi-hop reasoning while sustaining consistent performance as context length grows.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15920v2
Hallucination Detox: Sensitivity Dropout (SenD) for Large Language Model Training,"['Shahrad Mohammadzadeh', 'Juan David Guerra', 'Marco Bonizzato', 'Reihaneh Rabbany', 'Golnoosh Farnadi']","As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across various industries, concerns regarding their reliability, particularly due to hallucinations - outputs that are factually inaccurate or irrelevant to user input - have grown. Our research investigates the relationship between the training process and the emergence of hallucinations to address a key gap in existing research that focuses primarily on post hoc detection and mitigation strategies. Using models from the Pythia suite (70M - 12B parameters) and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends throughout training and explore LLM internal dynamics. We introduce Sensitivity Dropout (SenD), a novel training protocol designed to mitigate hallucinations by reducing variance during training. SenD achieves this by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability, referred to as Sensitive Embedding Indices. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore at 2x speed. This efficient metric is integrated into our protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucinations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach improves LLM reliability at test time by up to 40% compared to normal training while also providing an efficient method to improve factual accuracy when adapting LLMs to Wikipedia, Medical, and LegalBench domains.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15460v3

Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories.

To address this, we propose CORAL, a novel framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency in speculative drafting. CORAL introduces Cross-Step Representation Alignment, a method that enhances consistency across multiple training steps, significantly improving speculative drafting performance. Additionally, we identify the LM head as a major bottleneck in the inference speed of the draft model. We introduce a weight-grouping mechanism that selectively activates a subset of LM head parameters during inference, substantially reducing the latency of the draft model. We evaluate CORAL on three LLM families and three benchmark datasets, achieving speedup ratios of 2.50x-4.07x, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as EAGLE-2 and HASS. Our results demonstrate that CORAL effectively mitigates training-inference misalignment and delivers significant speedup for modern LLMs with large vocabularies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16880v3

Decoding Reading Goals from Eye Movements,"['Omer Shubi', 'Cfir Avraham Hadar', 'Yevgeni Berzak']","Readers can have different goals with respect to the text that they are reading. Can these goals be decoded from their eye movements over the text? In this work, we examine for the first time whether it is possible to distinguish between two types of common reading goals: information seeking and ordinary reading for comprehension. Using large-scale eye tracking data, we address this task with a wide range of models that cover different architectural and data representation strategies, and further introduce a new model ensemble. We find that transformer-based models with scanpath representations coupled with language modeling solve it most successfully, and that accurate predictions can be made in real time, long before the participant finished reading the text. We further introduce a new method for model performance analysis based on mixed effect modeling. Combining this method with rich textual annotations reveals key properties of textual items and participants that contribute to the difficulty of the task, and improves our understanding of the variability in eye movement patterns across the two reading regimes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20779v3
Uncovering Visual-Semantic Psycholinguistic Properties from the Distributional Structure of Text Embedding Space,"['Si Wu', 'Sebastian Bruch']","Imageability (potential of text to evoke a mental image) and concreteness (perceptibility of text) are two psycholinguistic properties that link visual and semantic spaces. It is little surprise that computational methods that estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these properties for classification.

MLLMs suffer from two key issues: misinterpreting UI components and outdated knowledge. Traditional fine-tuning methods are costly for app-specific knowledge updates. We propose GUI-explorer, a training-free GUI agent that incorporates two fundamental mechanisms: (1) Autonomous Exploration of Function-aware Trajectory. To comprehensively cover all application functionalities, we design a Function-aware Task Goal Generator that automatically constructs exploration goals by analyzing GUI structural information (e.g., screenshots and activity hierarchies). This enables systematic exploration to collect diverse trajectories. (2) Unsupervised Mining of Transition-aware Knowledge. To establish precise screen-operation logic, we develop a Transition-aware Knowledge Extractor that extracts effective screen-operation logic through unsupervised analysis the state transition of structured interaction triples (observation, action, outcome). This eliminates the need for human involvement in knowledge extraction. With a task success rate of 53.7% on SPA-Bench and 47.4% on AndroidWorld, GUI-explorer shows significant improvements over SOTA agents. It requires no parameter updates for new apps.

P$^2$ Law: Scaling Law for Post-Training After Model Pruning,"['Xiaodong Chen', 'Yuxuan Hu', 'Xiaokang Zhang', 'Yanling Wang', 'Cuiping Li', 'Hong Chen', 'Jing Zhang']","Pruning has become a widely adopted technique for reducing the hardware requirements of large language models (LLMs). To recover model performance after pruning, post-training is commonly employed to mitigate the resulting performance degradation. While post-training benefits from larger datasets, once the dataset size is already substantial, increasing the training data provides only limited performance gains. To balance post-training cost and model performance, it is necessary to explore the optimal amount of post-training data.Through extensive experiments on the Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 series models, pruned using various common pruning methods, we uncover the scaling \textbf{Law} for \textbf{P}ost-training after model \textbf{P}runing, referred to as the P$^2$ Law.This law identifies four key factors for predicting the pruned model's post-training loss: the model size before pruning, the number of post-training tokens, the pruning rate, and the model's loss before pruning. Moreover, P$^2$ Law can generalize to larger dataset sizes, larger model sizes, and higher pruning rates, offering valuable insights for the post-training of pruned LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10272v3
Making FETCH! Happen: Finding Emergent Dog Whistles Through Common Habitats,"['Kuleen Sasse', 'Carlos Alejandro Aguirre', 'Isabel Cachola', 'Sharon Levy', 'Mark Dredze']","WARNING: This paper contains content that maybe upsetting or offensive to some readers.

Identification of dog whistles relies on curated lexicons, which have trouble keeping up to date. We introduce FETCH!, a task for finding novel dog whistles in massive social media corpora.

Entailment-Preserving First-order Logic Representations in Natural Language Entailment,"['Jinu Lee', 'Qi Liu', 'Runzhi Ma', 'Vincent Han', 'Ziqi Wang', 'Heng Ji', 'Julia Hockenmaier']","First-order logic (FOL) can represent the logical entailment semantics of natural language (NL) sentences, but determining natural language entailment using FOL remains a challenge. To address this, we propose the Entailment-Preserving FOL representations (EPF) task and introduce reference-free evaluation metrics for EPF, the Entailment-Preserving Rate (EPR) family. In EPF, one should generate FOL representations from multi-premise natural language entailment data (e.g. EntailmentBank) so that the automatic prover's result preserves the entailment labels. Experiments show that existing methods for NL-to-FOL translation struggle in EPF. To this extent, we propose a training method specialized for the task, iterative learning-to-rank, which directly optimizes the model's EPR score through a novel scoring function and a learning-to-rank objective. Our method achieves a 1.8-2.7% improvement in EPR and a 17.4-20.6% increase in EPR@16 compared to diverse baselines in three datasets. Further analyses reveal that iterative learning-to-rank effectively suppresses the arbitrariness of FOL representation by reducing the diversity of predicate signatures, and maintains strong performance across diverse inference types and out-of-domain data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16757v1
Enhancing Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning with BranchLoRA,"['Duzhen Zhang', 'Yong Ren', 'Zhong-Zhi Li', 'Yahan Yu', 'Jiahua Dong', 'Chenxing Li', 'Zhilong Ji', 'Jinfeng Bai']","Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to finetune Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to continually align with human intent across sequential tasks. Existing approaches often rely on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LoRA framework to preserve previous instruction alignments. However, these methods are prone to Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), as they aggregate all LoRA blocks via simple summation, which compromises performance over time. In this paper, we identify a critical parameter inefficiency in the MoELoRA framework within the MCIT context. Based on this insight, we propose BranchLoRA, an asymmetric framework to enhance both efficiency and performance. To mitigate CF, we introduce a flexible tuning-freezing mechanism within BranchLoRA, enabling branches to specialize in intra-task knowledge while fostering inter-task collaboration. Moreover, we incrementally incorporate task-specific routers to ensure an optimal branch distribution over time, rather than favoring the most recent task. To streamline inference, we introduce a task selector that automatically routes test inputs to the appropriate router without requiring task identity. Extensive experiments on the latest MCIT benchmark demonstrate that BranchLoRA significantly outperforms MoELoRA and maintains its superiority across various MLLM sizes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02041v1
Enhancing Automated Interpretability with Output-Centric Feature Descriptions,"['Yoav Gur-Arieh', 'Roy Mayan', 'Chen Agassy', 'Atticus Geiger', 'Mor Geva']","Automated interpretability pipelines generate natural language descriptions for the concepts represented by features in large language models (LLMs), such as plants or the first word in a sentence. These descriptions are derived using inputs that activate the feature, which may be a dimension or a direction in the model's representation space. However, identifying activating inputs is costly, and the mechanistic role of a feature in model behavior is determined both by how inputs cause a feature to activate and by how feature activation affects outputs. Using steering evaluations, we reveal that current pipelines provide descriptions that fail to capture the causal effect of the feature on outputs. To fix this, we propose efficient, output-centric methods for automatically generating feature descriptions. These methods use the tokens weighted higher after feature stimulation or the highest weight tokens after applying the vocabulary ""unembedding"" head directly to the feature. Our output-centric descriptions better capture the causal effect of a feature on model outputs than input-centric descriptions, but combining the two leads to the best performance on both input and output evaluations. Lastly, we show that output-centric descriptions can be used to find inputs that activate features previously thought to be ""dead"".",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08319v2

The previous methods achieve high attack performance while being too cumbersome and time-consuming. Also, they have concentrated solely on optimization algorithms, overlooking the crucial role of the prompt. To this end, we propose a method called POUGH that incorporates an efficient optimization algorithm and two semantics-guided prompt organization strategies. Specifically, our method starts with a sampling strategy to select representative prompts from a candidate pool, followed by a ranking strategy that prioritizes them. Given the sequentially ranked prompts, our method employs an iterative optimization algorithm to generate a fixed suffix that can concatenate to arbitrary user prompts for universal goal hijacking.

However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what exactly quantifies natural language prompts. We attempt to address this question by conducting a meta-analysis surveying more than 150 prompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences from 2022 to 2025 and blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating prompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We then examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their imbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps. Further, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural language prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. We then empirically explore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact. Finally, we discover that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can result in better reasoning models. Our findings establish a foundation for property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, bridging the gaps between human--AI communication and opening new prompting research directions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06950v1

Prior work has shown that adapters show promise for, e.g., improving low-resource machine translation (MT). In this work, we investigate an adapter souping method combined with cross-attention fine-tuning of a pre-trained MT model to leverage language transfer for three low-resource Creole languages, which exhibit relatedness to different language groups across distinct linguistic dimensions. Our approach improves performance substantially over baselines. However, we find that linguistic relatedness -- or even a lack thereof -- does not covary meaningfully with adapter performance. Surprisingly, our cross-attention fine-tuning approach appears equally effective with randomly initialized adapters, implying that the benefit of adapters in this setting lies in parameter regularization, and not in meaningful information transfer. We provide analysis supporting this regularization hypothesis. Our findings underscore the reality that neural language processing involves many success factors, and that not all neural methods leverage linguistic knowledge in intuitive ways.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24525v1
X-TURING: Towards an Enhanced and Efficient Turing Test for Long-Term Dialogue Agents,"['Weiqi Wu', 'Hongqiu Wu', 'hai zhao']","The Turing test examines whether AIs exhibit human-like behaviour in natural language conversations. The traditional setting limits each participant to one message at a time and requires constant human participation. This fails to reflect a natural conversational style and hinders the evaluation of dialogue agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex and prolonged interactions. This paper proposes \textbf{\textsc{X-Turing}}, which enhances the original test with a \textit{burst dialogue} pattern, allowing more dynamic exchanges using consecutive messages. It further reduces human workload by iteratively generating dialogues that simulate the long-term interaction between the agent and a human to compose the majority of the test process. With the \textit{pseudo-dialogue} history, the agent then engages in a shorter dialogue with a real human, which is paired with a human-human conversation on the same topic to be judged using questionnaires. We introduce the \textit{X-Turn Pass-Rate} metric to assess the human likeness of LLMs across varying durations. While LLMs like GPT-4 initially perform well, achieving pass rates of 51.9\% and 38.9\% during 3 turns and 10 turns of dialogues respectively, their performance drops as the dialogue progresses, which underscores the difficulty in maintaining consistency in the long term.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09853v2
Are Rules Meant to be Broken? Understanding Multilingual Moral Reasoning as a Computational Pipeline with UniMoral,"['Shivani Kumar', 'David Jurgens']","Moral reasoning is a complex cognitive process shaped by individual experiences and cultural contexts and presents unique challenges for computational analysis. While natural language processing (NLP) offers promising tools for studying this phenomenon, current research lacks cohesion, employing discordant datasets and tasks that examine isolated aspects of moral reasoning. We bridge this gap with UniMoral, a unified dataset integrating psychologically grounded and social-media-derived moral dilemmas annotated with labels for action choices, ethical principles, contributing factors, and consequences, alongside annotators' moral and cultural profiles. Recognizing the cultural relativity of moral reasoning, UniMoral spans six languages, Arabic, Chinese, English, Hindi, Russian, and Spanish, capturing diverse socio-cultural contexts. We demonstrate UniMoral's utility through a benchmark evaluations of three large language models (LLMs) across four tasks: action prediction, moral typology classification, factor attribution analysis, and consequence generation. Key findings reveal that while implicitly embedded moral contexts enhance the moral reasoning capability of LLMs, there remains a critical need for increasingly specialized approaches to further advance moral reasoning in these models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14083v1
Modality-Aware Neuron Pruning for Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models,"['Zheyuan Liu', 'Guangyao Dou', 'Xiangchi Yuan', 'Chunhui Zhang', 'Zhaoxuan Tan', 'Meng Jiang']","Generative models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive datasets can lead them to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information, raising ethical and privacy concerns. While some prior works have explored this issue in the context of LLMs, it presents a unique challenge for MLLMs due to the entangled nature of knowledge across modalities, making comprehensive unlearning more difficult. To address this challenge, we propose Modality Aware Neuron Unlearning (MANU), a novel unlearning framework for MLLMs designed to selectively clip neurons based on their relative importance to the targeted forget data, curated for different modalities. Specifically, MANU consists of two stages: important neuron selection and selective pruning. The first stage identifies and collects the most influential neurons across modalities relative to the targeted forget knowledge, while the second stage is dedicated to pruning those selected neurons. MANU effectively isolates and removes the neurons that contribute most to the forget data within each modality, while preserving the integrity of retained knowledge. Our experiments conducted across various MLLM architectures illustrate that MANU can achieve a more balanced and comprehensive unlearning in each modality without largely affecting the overall model utility.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15910v2

Nutrition Question Answering (QA) has emerged as a popular method for addressing this problem. However, current research faces two critical limitations. On one hand, the absence of datasets involving user-specific medical information severely limits \textit{personalization}. This challenge is further compounded by the wide variability in individual health needs. On the other hand, while large language models (LLMs), a popular solution for this task, demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they struggle with the domain-specific complexities of personalized healthy dietary reasoning, and existing benchmarks fail to capture these challenges. To address these gaps, we introduce the Nutritional Graph Question Answering (NGQA) benchmark, the first graph question answering dataset designed for personalized nutritional health reasoning. NGQA leverages data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to evaluate whether a food is healthy for a specific user, supported by explanations of the key contributing nutrients. The benchmark incorporates three question complexity settings and evaluates reasoning across three downstream tasks. Extensive experiments with LLM backbones and baseline models demonstrate that the NGQA benchmark effectively challenges existing models.

Understanding Cross-Domain Adaptation in Low-Resource Topic Modeling,"['Pritom Saha Akash', 'Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang']","Topic modeling plays a vital role in uncovering hidden semantic structures within text corpora, but existing models struggle in low-resource settings where limited target-domain data leads to unstable and incoherent topic inference. We address this challenge by formally introducing domain adaptation for low-resource topic modeling, where a high-resource source domain informs a low-resource target domain without overwhelming it with irrelevant content. We establish a finite-sample generalization bound showing that effective knowledge transfer depends on robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space discrepancy, and preventing overfitting to the data. Guided by these insights, we propose DALTA (Domain-Aligned Latent Topic Adaptation), a new framework that employs a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment to selectively transfer relevant information. Experiments on diverse low-resource datasets demonstrate that DALTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of topic coherence, stability, and transferability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07453v1

To improve LLMs' factual expressions, we propose the UAlign framework, which leverages Uncertainty estimations to represent knowledge boundaries, and then explicitly incorporates these representations as input features into prompts for LLMs to Align with factual knowledge. First, we prepare the dataset on knowledge question-answering (QA) samples by calculating two uncertainty estimations, including confidence score and semantic entropy, to represent the knowledge boundaries for LLMs. Subsequently, using the prepared dataset, we train a reward model that incorporates uncertainty estimations and then employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for factuality alignment on LLMs. Experimental results indicate that, by integrating uncertainty representations in LLM alignment, the proposed UAlign can significantly enhance the LLMs' capacities to confidently answer known questions and refuse unknown questions on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, showing reliability improvements and good generalizability over various prompt- and training-based baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11803v2

To bridge this gap, we introduce HoH, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of outdated information on RAG. Our benchmark leverages token-level diff algorithms combined with LLM pipelines to efficiently create a large-scale QA dataset that accurately captures the evolution of temporal knowledge in real-world facts. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that outdated information significantly degrades RAG performance in two critical ways: (1) it substantially reduces response accuracy by distracting models from correct information, and (2) it can mislead models into generating potentially harmful outputs, even when current information is available.

We demonstrate that this scale-invariant behavior is unique to RoPE, emerges through distinct evolutionary phases during training, and statistically adheres to the fundamental uncertainty principle. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of modern Transformers stems from their remarkable ability to spontaneously develop optimal, multi-resolution decompositions to address inherent architectural constraints.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18067v4
Are the Hidden States Hiding Something?

They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness. However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism, which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the findings from previous studies are partially validated, generalization to LLM-generated datasets remains challenging.

This study probes the hidden layers of Llama models to pinpoint where sentiment features are most represented and to assess how this affects sentiment analysis. Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment signals. Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to 14% over prompting techniques. Additionally, we find that in decoder-only models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment encoding. Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with memory requirements reduced by an average of 57%. These insights contribute to a broader understanding of sentiment in LLMs, suggesting layer-specific probing as an effective approach for sentiment tasks beyond prompting, with potential to enhance model utility and reduce memory requirements.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16491v2

To address these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations (HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space. Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment.

F5-TTS: A Fairytaler that Fakes Fluent and Faithful Speech with Flow Matching,"['Yushen CHEN', 'Zhikang Niu', 'Ziyang Ma', 'Keqi Deng', 'Chunhui Wang', 'JianZhao', 'Kai Yu', 'Xie Chen']","This paper introduces F5-TTS, a fully non-autoregressive text-to-speech system based on flow matching with Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Without requiring complex designs such as duration model, text encoder, and phoneme alignment, the text input is simply padded with filler tokens to the same length as input speech, and then the denoising is performed for speech generation, which was originally proved feasible by E2 TTS. However, the original design of E2 TTS makes it hard to follow due to its slow convergence and low robustness. To address these issues, we first model the input with ConvNeXt to refine the text representation, making it easy to align with the speech. We further propose an inference-time Sway Sampling strategy, which significantly improves our model's performance and efficiency. This sampling strategy for flow step can be easily applied to existing flow matching based models without retraining. Our design allows faster training and achieves an inference RTF of 0.15, which is greatly improved compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based TTS models. Trained on a public 100K hours multilingual dataset, our F5-TTS exhibits highly natural and expressive zero-shot ability, seamless code-switching capability, and speed control efficiency. We have released all codes and checkpoints to promote community development, at https://SWivid.github.io/F5-TTS/.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06885v3

We provide JUDGE-BENCH, an extensible collection of 20 NLP datasets with human annotations covering a broad range of evaluated properties and types of data, and comprehensively evaluate 11 current LLMs, covering both open-weight and proprietary models, for their ability to replicate the annotations. Our evaluations show substantial variance across models and datasets. Models are reliable evaluators on some tasks, but overall display substantial variability depending on the property being evaluated, the expertise level of the human judges, and whether the language is human or model-generated. We conclude that LLMs should be carefully validated against human judgments before being used as evaluators.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18403v3
AutoMedEval: Harnessing Language Models for Automatic Medical Capability Evaluation,"['Xiechi Zhang', 'Zetian Ouyang', 'Linlin Wang', 'Gerard de Melo', 'Zhu Cao', 'Xiaoling Wang', 'Ya Zhang', 'Yanfeng Wang', 'Liang He']","With the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, there is increasing demand for improved evaluation techniques to assess their capabilities. However, traditional metrics like F1 and ROUGE, which rely on token overlaps to measure quality, significantly overlook the importance of medical terminology. While human evaluation tends to be more reliable, it can be very costly and may as well suffer from inaccuracies due to limits in human expertise and motivation. Although there are some evaluation methods based on LLMs, their usability in the medical field is limited due to their proprietary nature or lack of expertise. To tackle these challenges, we present AutoMedEval, an open-sourced automatic evaluation model with 13B parameters specifically engineered to measure the question-answering proficiency of medical LLMs. The overarching objective of AutoMedEval is to assess the quality of responses produced by diverse models, aspiring to significantly reduce the dependence on human evaluation. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical training method involving curriculum instruction tuning and an iterative knowledge introspection mechanism, enabling AutoMedEval to acquire professional medical assessment capabilities with limited instructional data. Human evaluations indicate that AutoMedEval surpasses other baselines in terms of correlation with human judgments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11887v1
CoT-based Synthesizer: Enhancing LLM Performance through Answer Synthesis,"['Bohan Zhang', 'Xiaokang Zhang', 'Jing Zhang', 'Jifan Yu', 'Sijia Luo', 'Jie Tang']","Current inference scaling methods, such as Self-consistency and Best-of-N, have proven effective in improving the accuracy of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. However, these methods rely heavily on the quality of candidate responses and are unable to produce correct answers when all candidates are incorrect. In this paper, we propose a novel inference scaling strategy, CoT-based Synthesizer, which leverages CoT reasoning to synthesize superior answers by analyzing complementary information from multiple candidate responses, even when all candidate responses are flawed. To enable a lightweight and cost-effective implementation, we introduce an automated data generation pipeline that creates diverse training data. This allows smaller LLMs trained on this data to improve the inference accuracy of larger models, including API-based LLMs. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets with seven policy models demonstrate that our method significantly enhances performance, with gains of 11.8% for Llama3-8B and 10.3% for GPT-4o on the MATH dataset.

Efficiently Identifying Watermarked Segments in Mixed-Source Texts,"['Xuandong Zhao', 'Chenwen Liao', 'Yu-Xiang Wang', 'Lei Li']","Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to detect synthetic text, mitigating misuse cases like fake news and academic dishonesty. While existing watermarking detection techniques primarily focus on classifying entire documents as watermarked or not, they often neglect the common scenario of identifying individual watermark segments within longer, mixed-source documents. Drawing inspiration from plagiarism detection systems, we propose two novel methods for partial watermark detection. First, we develop a geometry cover detection framework aimed at determining whether there is a watermark segment in long text. Second, we introduce an adaptive online learning algorithm to pinpoint the precise location of watermark segments within the text. Evaluated on three popular watermarking techniques (KGW-Watermark, Unigram-Watermark, and Gumbel-Watermark), our approach achieves high accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Moreover, our framework is adaptable to other watermarking techniques, offering new insights for precise watermark detection.

FocalPO: Enhancing Preference Optimizing by Focusing on Correct Preference Rankings,"['Tong Liu', 'Xiao Yu', 'Wenxuan Zhou', 'Jindong Gu', 'Volker Tresp']","Efficient preference optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have become a popular approach in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. These algorithms implicitly treat the LLM as a reward model, and focus on training it to correct misranked preference pairs. However, recent work~\citep{chen2024preference} empirically finds that DPO training \textit{rarely improves these misranked preference pairs}, despite its gradient emphasizing on these cases. We introduce FocalPO, a DPO variant that instead \textit{down-weighs} misranked preference pairs and prioritizes enhancing the model's understanding of pairs that it can already rank correctly. Inspired by Focal Loss used in vision tasks, FocalPO achieves this by adding a modulating factor to dynamically scale DPO loss. Our experiment demonstrates that FocalPO surpasses DPO and its variants on popular benchmarks like Alpaca Eval 2.0 using Mistral-Base-7B and Llama-3-Instruct-8B, with the introduced hyperparameter fixed. Additionally, we empirically reveals how FocalPO affects training on correct and incorrect sample groups, further underscoring its effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06645v2

While benchmarks, including those designed for multiple languages, are often used as proxies to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they tend to overlook the nuances of within-language variation and thus fail to model the experience of speakers of non-standard dialects. Focusing on African American Vernacular English (AAVE), we present the first study aimed at objectively assessing the fairness and robustness of LLMs in handling dialects across canonical reasoning tasks, including algorithm, math, logic, and integrated reasoning. We introduce ReDial (Reasoning with Dialect Queries), a benchmark containing 1.2K+ parallel query pairs in Standardized English and AAVE. We hire AAVE speakers, including experts with computer science backgrounds, to rewrite seven popular benchmarks, such as HumanEval and GSM8K. With ReDial, we evaluate widely used LLMs, including GPT, Claude, Llama, Mistral, and the Phi model families. Our findings reveal that almost all of these widely used models show significant brittleness and unfairness to queries in AAVE.

Moreover, it highlights how mainstream LLMs provide unfair service to dialect speakers in reasoning tasks, laying a critical foundation for future research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11005v3
Towards a More Generalized Approach in Open Relation Extraction,"['Qing Wang', 'Yuepei Li', 'Qiao Qiao', 'Kang Zhou', 'Qi Li']","Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) seeks to identify and extract novel relational facts between named entities from unlabeled data without pre-defined relation schemas. Traditional OpenRE methods typically assume that the unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is pre-divided into known and novel instances. However, in real-world scenarios, novel relations are arbitrarily distributed. In this paper, we propose a generalized OpenRE setting that considers unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel instances. To address this, we propose MixORE, a two-phase framework that integrates relation classification and clustering to jointly learn known and novel relations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MixORE consistently outperforms competitive baselines in known relation classification and novel relation clustering. Our findings contribute to the advancement of generalized OpenRE research and real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22801v1

We bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of 35 adaptive retrieval methods, including 8 recent approaches and 27 uncertainty estimation techniques, across 6 datasets using 10 metrics for QA performance, self-knowledge, and efficiency.

Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks.

Learning to Rewrite: Generalized LLM-Generated Text Detection,"['Wei Hao', 'Ran Li', 'Weiliang Zhao', 'Junfeng Yang', 'Chengzhi Mao']","Large language models (LLMs) present significant risks when used to generate non-factual content and spread disinformation at scale. Detecting such LLM-generated content is crucial, yet current detectors often struggle to generalize in open-world contexts. We introduce Learning2Rewrite, a novel framework for detecting AI-generated text with exceptional generalization to unseen domains. Our method leverages the insight that LLMs inherently modify AI-generated content less than human-written text when tasked with rewriting. By training LLMs to minimize alterations on AI-generated inputs, we amplify this disparity, yielding a more distinguishable and generalizable edit distance across diverse text distributions. Extensive experiments on data from 21 independent domains and four major LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama-3) demonstrate that our detector outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods by up to 23.04% in AUROC for in-distribution tests, 37.26% for out-of-distribution tests, and 48.66% under adversarial attacks. Our unique training objective ensures better generalizability compared to directly training for classification, when leveraging the same amount of parameters. Our findings suggest that reinforcing LLMs' inherent rewriting tendencies offers a robust and scalable solution for detecting AI-generated text.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04237v2

However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption.

Our method updates only salient columns, while injecting Gaussian noise into non-salient ones. To identify these columns, we developeda generalized sensitivity metric that extends and unifies metrics from previous studies. Experiments with LLaMA models demonstrate that GIFT-SW outperforms full fine-tuning and modern PEFT methods under the same computational budget.

Quaff: Quantized Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning under Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis,"['Hong Huang', 'Dapeng Wu']","Large language models (LLMs) have made exciting achievements across various domains, yet their deployment on resource-constrained personal devices remains hindered by the prohibitive computational and memory demands of task-specific fine-tuning. While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning, certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across training iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically suppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight operations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling while reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks validate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory savings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the Phi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance, and deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080 Super) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM deployment.

Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is widely used to assess the understanding capability of LMMs, but it does not guarantee that LMMs truly comprehend the answer. UPD assesses the LMM's ability to withhold answers when encountering unsolvable problems of MCQA, verifying whether the model truly understands the answer. UPD encompasses three problems: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD), covering unsolvable cases like answer-lacking or incompatible choices and image-question mismatches. For the evaluation, we introduce the MM-UPD Bench, a benchmark for assessing performance across various ability dimensions. Our experiments reveal that even most LMMs, which demonstrate adequate performance on existing benchmarks, struggle significantly with MM-UPD, underscoring a novel aspect of trustworthiness that current benchmarks have overlooked.

Can Language Models Reason about Individualistic Human Values and Preferences?,"['Liwei Jiang', 'Taylor Sorensen', 'Sydney Levine', 'Yejin Choi']","Recent calls for pluralistic alignment emphasize that AI systems should address the diverse needs of all people. Yet, efforts in this space often require sorting people into fixed buckets of pre-specified diversity-defining dimensions (e.g., demographics), risking smoothing out individualistic variations or even stereotyping. To achieve an authentic representation of diversity that respects individuality, we propose individualistic alignment. While individualistic alignment can take various forms, we introduce IndieValueCatalog, a dataset transformed from the influential World Values Survey (WVS), to study language models (LMs) on the specific challenge of individualistic value reasoning. Given a sample of an individual's value-expressing statements, models are tasked with predicting this person's value judgments in novel cases. With IndieValueCatalog, we reveal critical limitations in frontier LMs, which achieve only 55 % to 65% accuracy in predicting individualistic values. Moreover, our results highlight that a precise description of individualistic values cannot be approximated only with demographic information. We also identify a partiality of LMs in reasoning about global individualistic values, as measured by our proposed Value Inequity Index ({\sigma}Inequity).

Speculative decoding represents a lossless approach to accelerate inference through a guess-and-verify paradigm. Some methods rely on additional architectures to guess draft tokens, which need extra training before use. Alternatively, retrieval-based training-free techniques build libraries from pre-existing corpora or by n-gram generation. However, they face challenges like large storage requirements, time-consuming retrieval, and limited adaptability. Observing that candidate tokens generated during the decoding process are likely to reoccur in future sequences, we propose Token Recycling. It stores candidate tokens in an adjacency matrix and employs a breadth-first-search (BFS)-like algorithm to construct a draft tree, which is then validated through tree attention. New candidate tokens from the decoding process are then used to update the matrix. Token Recycling requires \textless2MB of additional storage and achieves approximately 2x speedup across all sizes of LLMs. It significantly outperforms existing train-free methods by 30\% and even a widely recognized training method by 25\%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08696v3

Existing work finds that the capability of long CoT reasoning can be efficiently elicited by tuning on only a few examples and can easily transfer to other tasks. This motivates us to investigate whether long CoT reasoning is a general capability for LLMs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis for this question from the perspective of representation. We find that LLMs do encode long CoT reasoning as a general capability, with a clear distinction from vanilla CoTs. Furthermore, domain-specific representations are also required for the effective transfer of long CoT reasoning.

Model merging, which integrates multiple expert models into a single multi-task model, introduces a novel risk of unauthorized use of LLMs due to its efficient merging process. While fingerprinting techniques have been proposed for verifying model ownership, their resistance to model merging remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel fingerprinting method, MergePrint, which embeds robust fingerprints capable of surviving model merging. MergePrint enables black-box ownership verification, where owners only need to check if a model produces target outputs for specific fingerprint inputs, without accessing model weights or intermediate outputs. By optimizing against a pseudo-merged model that simulates merged behavior, MergePrint ensures fingerprints that remain detectable after merging. Additionally, to minimize performance degradation, we pre-optimize the fingerprint inputs. MergePrint pioneers a practical solution for black-box ownership verification, protecting LLMs from misappropriation via merging, while also excelling in resistance to broader model theft threats.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08604v4

The execution results of unit tests serve as reward signals to identify correct solutions. As LLMs always confidently make mistakes, these unit tests are not reliable, thereby diminishing the quality of reward signals. Motivated by the observation that scaling the number of solutions improves LLM performance, we explore the impact of scaling unit tests to enhance reward signal quality. Our pioneer experiment reveals a positive correlation between the number of unit tests and reward signal quality, with greater benefits observed in more challenging problems. Based on these insights, we propose CodeRM-8B, a lightweight yet effective unit test generator that enables efficient and high-quality unit test scaling. Additionally, we implement a dynamic scaling mechanism that adapts the number of unit tests based on problem difficulty, further improving efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves performance across various models on three benchmarks (e.g., with gains of 18.43% for Llama3-8B and 3.42% for GPT-4o-mini on HumanEval Plus).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01054v1

Towards Effective Extraction and Evaluation of Factual Claims,"['Dasha Metropolitansky', 'Jonathan Larson']","A common strategy for fact-checking long-form content generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is extracting simple claims that can be verified independently. Since inaccurate or incomplete claims compromise fact-checking results, ensuring claim quality is critical. However, the lack of a standardized evaluation framework impedes assessment and comparison of claim extraction methods. To address this gap, we propose a framework for evaluating claim extraction in the context of fact-checking along with automated, scalable, and replicable methods for applying this framework, including novel approaches for measuring coverage and decontextualization. We also introduce Claimify, an LLM-based claim extraction method, and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods under our evaluation framework. A key feature of Claimify is its ability to handle ambiguity and extract claims only when there is high confidence in the correct interpretation of the source text.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10855v2
Beyond Facts: Evaluating Intent Hallucination in Large Language Models,"['Yijie Hao', 'Haofei Yu', 'Jiaxuan You']","When exposed to complex queries containing multiple conditions, today's large language models (LLMs) tend to produce responses that only partially satisfy the query while neglecting certain conditions. We therefore introduce the concept of Intent Hallucination. In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit (neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented query parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated generation. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068 problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for state-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or misinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an automatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting intent hallucination. Human evaluation results demonstrate that CONSTRAINT SCORE is closer to human performance for intent hallucination compared to baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06539v1

Despite achievements in sub-tasks such as lyric generation, lyric-to-melody, and melody-to-lyric, etc, a unified model for song composition has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we introduce SongComposer, a pioneering step towards a unified song composition model that can readily create symbolic lyrics and melodies following instructions. SongComposer is a music-specialized large language model (LLM) that, for the first time, integrates the capability of simultaneously composing lyrics and melodies into LLMs by leveraging three key innovations: 1) a flexible tuple format for word-level alignment of lyrics and melodies, 2) an extended tokenizer vocabulary for song notes, with scalar initialization based on musical knowledge to capture rhythm, and 3) a multi-stage pipeline that captures musical structure, starting with motif-level melody patterns and progressing to phrase-level structure for improved coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SongComposer outperforms advanced LLMs, including GPT-4, in tasks such as lyric-to-melody generation, melody-to-lyric generation, song continuation, and text-to-song creation. Moreover, we will release SongCompose, a large-scale dataset for training, containing paired lyrics and melodies in Chinese and English.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17645v2
Personalized Text Generation with Contrastive Activation Steering,"['Jinghao Zhang', 'Yuting Liu', 'Wenjie Wang', 'Qiang Liu', 'Shu Wu', 'Liang Wang', 'Tat-Seng Chua']","Personalized text generation aims to infer users' writing style preferences from their historical texts and generate outputs that faithfully reflect these stylistic characteristics. Existing solutions primarily adopt two paradigms: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While these approaches have advanced the field, they suffer from two critical limitations: (1) the entanglement of content semantics and stylistic patterns in historical texts impedes accurate modeling of user-specific writing preferences; and (2) scalability challenges arising from both RAG's inference latency by retrieval operations and PEFT's parameter storage requirements for per user model. To overcome these limitations, we propose StyleVector, a training-free framework that disentangles and represents personalized writing style as a vector in LLM's activation space, enabling style-steered generation during inference without requiring costly retrieval or parameter storage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves a significant 8% relative improvement in personalized generation while reducing storage requirements by 1700 times over PEFT method.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05213v1

However, fine-tuning these models remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated query-document pairs. Existing distillation-based approaches suffer from training-inference misalignment and fail to capture interdependencies among candidate documents. To overcome these limitations, we reframe the reranking process as an attention-mask problem and propose Gumbel Reranking, an end-to-end training framework for rerankers aimed at minimizing the training-inference gap. In our approach, reranker optimization is reformulated as learning a stochastic, document-wise Top-$k$ attention mask using the Gumbel Trick and Relaxed Top-$k$ Sampling. This formulation enables end-to-end optimization by minimizing the overall language loss. Experiments across various settings consistently demonstrate performance gains, including a 10.4\% improvement in recall on HotpotQA for distinguishing indirectly relevant documents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11116v2
Hybrid Preferences: Learning to Route Instances for Human vs. AI Feedback,"['Lester James Validad Miranda', 'Yizhong Wang', 'Yanai Elazar', 'Sachin Kumar', 'Valentina Pyatkin', 'Faeze Brahman', 'Noah A. Smith', 'Hannaneh Hajishirzi', 'Pradeep Dasigi']","Learning from human feedback has enabled the alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences. However, collecting human preferences is expensive and time-consuming, with highly variable annotation quality. An appealing alternative is to distill preferences from LMs as a source of synthetic annotations, offering a cost-effective and scalable alternative, albeit susceptible to other biases and errors. In this work, we introduce HyPER, a Hybrid Preference routER that defers an annotation to either humans or LMs, achieving better annotation quality while reducing the cost of human-only annotation. We formulate this as an optimization problem: given a preference dataset and an evaluation metric, we (1) train a performance prediction model (PPM) to predict a reward model's (RM) performance on an arbitrary combination of human and LM annotations and (2) employ a routing strategy that selects a combination that maximizes the predicted performance. We train the PPM on MultiPref, a new preference dataset with 10k instances paired with humans and LM labels. We show that the selected hybrid mixture of synthetic and direct human preferences using HyPER achieves better RM performance compared to using either one exclusively by 7-13% on RewardBench and generalizes across unseen preference datasets and other base models. We also observe the same trend in other benchmarks using Best-of-N reranking, where the hybrid mix has 2-3% better performance. Finally, we analyze features from HyPER and find that prompts with moderate safety concerns or complexity benefit the most from human feedback.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19133v5
SEOE: A Scalable and Reliable Semantic Evaluation Framework for Open Domain Event Detection,"['Yi-Fan Lu', 'Xian-Ling Mao', 'Tian Lan', 'Tong Zhang', 'Yu-Shi Zhu', 'Heyan Huang']","Automatic evaluation for Open Domain Event Detection (ODED) is a highly challenging task, because ODED is characterized by a vast diversity of un-constrained output labels from various domains. Nearly all existing evaluation methods for ODED usually first construct evaluation benchmarks with limited labels and domain coverage, and then evaluate ODED methods using metrics based on token-level label matching rules. However, this kind of evaluation framework faces two issues: (1) The limited evaluation benchmarks lack representatives of the real world, making it difficult to accurately reflect the performance of various ODED methods in real-world scenarios; (2) Evaluation metrics based on token-level matching rules fail to capture semantic similarity between predictions and golden labels. To address these two problems above, we propose a scalable and reliable Semantic-level Evaluation framework for Open domain Event detection (SEOE) by constructing a more representative evaluation benchmark and introducing a semantic evaluation metric. Specifically, our proposed framework first constructs a scalable evaluation benchmark that currently includes 564 event types covering 7 major domains, with a cost-effective supplementary annotation strategy to ensure the benchmark's representativeness. The strategy also allows for the supplement of new event types and domains in the future. Then, the proposed SEOE leverages large language models (LLMs) as automatic evaluation agents to compute a semantic F1-score, incorporating fine-grained definitions of semantically similar labels to enhance the reliability of the evaluation. Extensive experiments validate the representatives of the benchmark and the reliability of the semantic evaluation metric. Existing ODED methods are thoroughly evaluated, and the error patterns of predictions are analyzed, revealing several insightful findings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03303v2

Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$ effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving high-level efficiency and reliability.

Specifically, it first identifies dispute points to decompose complex cases, and then conducts step-wise reasoning while employing a process verifier to validate each step's logic from correctness, progressiveness, and potential perspectives. When errors are detected, expert-designed attribution and resolution strategies are applied for correction. To fine-tune LegalReasoner, we release the LegalHK dataset, containing 58,130 Hong Kong court cases with detailed annotations of dispute points, step-by-step reasoning chains, and process verification labels.

Rolling the DICE on Idiomaticity: How LLMs Fail to Grasp Context,"['Maggie Mi', 'Aline Villavicencio', 'Nafise Sadat Moosavi']","Human processing of idioms relies on understanding the contextual sentences in which idioms occur, as well as language-intrinsic features such as frequency and speaker-intrinsic factors like familiarity. While LLMs have shown high performance on idiomaticity detection tasks, this success may be attributed to reasoning shortcuts in existing datasets. To this end, we construct a novel, controlled contrastive dataset designed to test whether LLMs can effectively use context to disambiguate idiomatic meaning. Additionally, we explore how collocational frequency and sentence probability influence model performance. Our findings reveal that LLMs often fail to resolve idiomaticity when it is required to attend to the surrounding context, and that models perform better on sentences that have higher likelihood.

Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ChartCoder}, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code.

This task becomes particularly important in specialized medical, engineering, and other technical domains, owing to the highly infrequent usage of the terms and scarcity of data involving domain-specific terms especially for low/mid-resource languages.

How to Train Long-Context Language Models (Effectively),"['Tianyu Gao', 'Alexander Wettig', 'Howard Yen', 'Danqi Chen']","We study continued training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a language model (LM) to make effective use of long-context information. We first establish a reliable evaluation protocol to guide model development -- instead of perplexity or simple needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) tests, we use a broad set of long-context downstream tasks, and we evaluate models after SFT as this better reveals long-context abilities. Supported by our robust evaluations, we run thorough experiments to decide the data mix for continued pre-training, the instruction tuning dataset, and many other design choices such as position extrapolation. We find that (1) code repositories and books are excellent sources of long data, but it is crucial to combine them with high-quality short-context data; (2) training with a sequence length beyond the evaluation length boosts long-context performance; (3) for SFT, using only short instruction datasets yields strong performance on long-context tasks. Our final model, ProLong-8B, which is initialized from Llama-3 and trained on 40B tokens, demonstrates state-of-the-art long-context performance among similarly sized models at a length of 128K. ProLong outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the majority of long-context tasks despite using only 5% as many tokens during long-context training.

Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, \textbf{MathFusionQA}, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it.

Comprehensive evaluation across twelve VLMs, along with further analysis of various language-side and vision-side prompting methods, leads to a total of eight key findings. We identify critical challenges in models' ability to link visual cues, highlighting a significant performance gap. Based on these insights, we advocate for (i) enhancing core visual capabilities to improve adaptability and reduce reliance on prior knowledge, (ii) establishing clearer principles for integrating language-based reasoning in vision-centric tasks to prevent unnecessary biases, and (iii) shifting vision-text training paradigms toward fostering models' ability to independently structure and infer relationships among visual cues.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12084v4
Alleviating Distribution Shift in Synthetic Data for Machine Translation Quality Estimation,"['Xiang Geng', 'Zhejian Lai', 'Jiajun Chen', 'Hao Yang', 'Shujian Huang']","Quality Estimation (QE) models evaluate the quality of machine translations without reference translations, serving as the reward models for the translation task. Due to the data scarcity, synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution. However, synthetic QE data often suffers from distribution shift, which can manifest as discrepancies between pseudo and real translations, or in pseudo labels that do not align with human preferences. To tackle this issue, we introduce DCSQE, a novel framework for alleviating distribution shift in synthetic QE data. To reduce the difference between pseudo and real translations, we employ the constrained beam search algorithm and enhance translation diversity through the use of distinct generation models. DCSQE uses references, i.e., translation supervision signals, to guide both the generation and annotation processes, enhancing the quality of token-level labels. DCSQE further identifies the shortest phrase covering consecutive error tokens, mimicking human annotation behavior, to assign the final phrase-level labels. Specially, we underscore that the translation model can not annotate translations of itself accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCSQE outperforms SOTA baselines like CometKiwi in both supervised and unsupervised settings. Further analysis offers insights into synthetic data generation that could benefit reward models for other tasks.

In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools.

Despite significant efforts in evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), active perception has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a novel benchmark named ActiView to evaluate active perception in MLLMs. We focus on a specialized form of Visual Question Answering (VQA) that eases and quantifies the evaluation yet challenging for existing MLLMs. Meanwhile, intermediate reasoning behaviors of models are also discussed. Given an image, we restrict the perceptual field of a model, requiring it to actively zoom or shift its perceptual field based on reasoning to answer the question successfully. We conduct extensive evaluation over 30 models, including proprietary and open-source models, and observe that restricted perceptual fields play a significant role in enabling active perception. Results reveal a significant gap in the active perception capability of MLLMs, indicating that this area deserves more attention. We hope that ActiView could help develop methods for MLLMs to understand multimodal inputs in more natural and holistic ways.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04659v2
Enough Coin Flips Can Make LLMs Act Bayesian,"['Ritwik Gupta', 'Rodolfo Corona', 'Jiaxin Ge', 'Eric Wang', 'Dan Klein', 'Trevor Darrell', 'David M. Chan']","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit the ability to generalize given few-shot examples in their input prompt, an emergent capability known as in-context learning (ICL). We investigate whether LLMs use ICL to perform structured reasoning in ways that are consistent with a Bayesian framework or rely on pattern matching. Using a controlled setting of biased coin flips, we find that: (1) LLMs often possess biased priors, causing initial divergence in zero-shot settings, (2) in-context evidence outweighs explicit bias instructions, (3) LLMs broadly follow Bayesian posterior updates, with deviations primarily due to miscalibrated priors rather than flawed updates, and (4) attention magnitude has negligible effect on Bayesian inference. With sufficient demonstrations of biased coin flips via ICL, LLMs update their priors in a Bayesian manner.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04722v2

A Text is Worth Several Tokens: Text Embedding from LLMs Secretly Aligns Well with The Key Tokens,"['Zhijie Nie', 'Richong Zhang', 'Zhanyu Wu']","Text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) have achieved excellent results in tasks such as information retrieval, semantic textual similarity, etc. In this work, we show an interesting finding: when feeding a text into the LLM-based embedder, the obtained text embedding will be able to be aligned with the key tokens in the input text. We first fully analyze this phenomenon on eight LLM-based embedders and show that this phenomenon is universal and is not affected by model architecture, training strategy, and embedding method. With a deeper analysis, we find that the main change in embedding space between these embedders and their LLM backbones is in the first principal component. By adjusting the first principal component, we can align text embedding with the key tokens. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the vast application potential of this finding: (1) we propose a simple and practical sparse retrieval method based on the aligned tokens, which can achieve 80% of the dense retrieval effect of the same model while reducing the computation significantly; (2) we show that our findings provide a novel perspective to help understand novel technologies (e.g., instruction-following embedding) and fuzzy concepts (e.g., semantic relatedness vs. similarity) in this field.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17378v4

To address this, we introduce \datasetname, a commonsense reasoning dataset in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), covering cultures of 13 countries across the Gulf, Levant, North Africa, and the Nile Valley. The dataset was built from scratch by engaging native speakers to write and validate culturally relevant questions for their respective countries. \datasetname spans 12 daily life domains with 54 fine-grained subtopics, reflecting various aspects of social norms, traditions, and everyday experiences.

However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable, domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC quality, and theory of mind capabilities.

Large Language Models are Good Relational Learners,"['Fang Wu', 'Vijay Prakash Dwivedi', 'Jure Leskovec']","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL) remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically, the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources.

SpaRE: Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models with Synthetic Data,"['Michael Ogezi', 'Freda Shi']","Vision-language models (VLMs) work well in tasks ranging from image captioning to visual question answering (VQA), yet they struggle with spatial reasoning, a key skill for understanding our physical world that humans excel at. We find that spatial relations are generally rare in widely used VL datasets, with only a few being well represented, while most form a long tail of underrepresented relations. This gap leaves VLMs ill-equipped to handle diverse spatial relationships. To bridge it, we construct a synthetic VQA dataset focused on spatial reasoning generated from hyper-detailed image descriptions in Localized Narratives, DOCCI, and PixMo-Cap. Our dataset consists of 455k samples containing 3.4 million QA pairs. Trained on this dataset, our Spatial-Reasoning Enhanced (SpaRE) VLMs show strong improvements on spatial reasoning benchmarks, achieving up to a 49% performance gain on the What's Up benchmark, while maintaining strong results on general tasks.

Importantly, this process can be performed without annotated responses. We show that our Distilled Voice Assistant (DiVA) generalizes to Spoken Question Answering, Classification, and Translation.

CoMet: Metaphor-Driven Covert Communication for Multi-Agent Language Games,"['Shuhang Xu', 'Fangwei Zhong']","Metaphors are a crucial way for humans to express complex or subtle ideas by comparing one concept to another, often from a different domain. However, many large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and apply metaphors in multi-agent language games, hindering their ability to engage in covert communication and semantic evasion, which are crucial for strategic communication. To address this challenge, we introduce CoMet, a framework that enables LLM-based agents to engage in metaphor processing. CoMet combines a hypothesis-based metaphor reasoner with a metaphor generator that improves through self-reflection and knowledge integration. This enhances the agents' ability to interpret and apply metaphors, improving the strategic and nuanced quality of their interactions. We evaluate CoMet on two multi-agent language games - Undercover and Adversarial Taboo - which emphasize Covert Communication and Semantic Evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMet significantly enhances the agents' ability to communicate strategically using metaphors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18218v1

In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware framework designed to enhance the accuracy of LLM responses by systematically incorporating model confidence at critical decision points. We propose an approach that encourages multi-step reasoning in LLMs and quantify the confidence of intermediate answers such as numerical results in mathematical reasoning and proper nouns in open-domain generation. Then, the overall confidence of each reasoning chain is evaluated based on confidence of these critical intermediate steps. Finally, we aggregate the answer of generated response paths in a way that reflects the reliability of each generated content (as opposed to self-consistency in which each generated chain contributes equally to majority voting). We conducted extensive experiments in five datasets, three mathematical datasets and two open-domain datasets, using four LLMs. The results consistently validate the effectiveness of our novel confidence aggregation method, leading to an accuracy improvement of up to 7.4% and 5.8% over baseline approaches in math and open-domain generation tasks, respectively.

LLM Braces: Straightening Out LLM Predictions with Relevant Sub-Updates,"['Ying Shen', 'Lifu Huang']","Recent findings reveal that much of the knowledge in a Transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) is encoded in its feed-forward (FFN) layers, where each FNN layer can be interpreted as the summation of sub-updates, each corresponding to a weighted column vector from the FFN's value parameter matrix that often encodes human-interpretable concepts. In light of this, we hypothesize that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBRACES, a novel and efficient method that computes relevance scores associated with value vectors in FFN layers and leverages these scores to dynamically adjust the contribution of sub-updates. By optimizing sub-update contributions, LLMBRACES refines the prediction process, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs, much like a 'brace' providing support and stability. Moreover, LLMBRACES can be extended to support conditional control over generation characteristics, such as sentiment, thereby offering fine-grained steering of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments on various LLMs-including Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama2-7B, and Llama3-8B-demonstrate that LLMBRACES outperforms baseline approaches in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings while requiring significantly fewer tunable parameters, up to 75% fewer compared to LoRA. Furthermore, LLMBRACES excels in sentiment-controlled generation and toxicity reduction, highlighting its potential for flexible, controlled text generation across applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16334v2

Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109 human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs. These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs, conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that while some models are able to handle long conversations, and leverage more than 20+ APIs successfully, other models struggle with longer context or when increasing the number of APIs. We also report that the performance on chained function-calls is severely limited across the models. Overall, the top performing models on CONFETTI are Nova Pro (40.01%), Claude Sonnet v3.5 (35.46%) and Llama 3.1 405B (33.19%) followed by command-r-plus (31.18%) and Mistral-Large-2407 (30.07%).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01859v1

When People are Floods: Analyzing Dehumanizing Metaphors in Immigration Discourse with Large Language Models,"['Julia Mendelsohn', 'Ceren Budak']","Metaphor, discussing one concept in terms of another, is abundant in politics and can shape how people understand important issues.

We propose and evaluate a novel technique that leverages both word-level and document-level signals to measure metaphor with respect to these concepts. We then study the relationship between metaphor, political ideology, and user engagement in 400K US tweets about immigration. While conservatives tend to use dehumanizing metaphors more than liberals, this effect varies widely across concepts.

Based on psycholinguistic research, we formulate hypotheses on why garden-path sentences are hard, and test these hypotheses on human participants and a large suite of LLMs using comprehension questions. Our findings reveal that both LLMs and humans struggle with specific syntactic complexities, with some models showing high correlation with human comprehension.

VLSBench: Unveiling Visual Leakage in Multimodal Safety,"['Xuhao Hu', 'Dongrui Liu', 'Hao Li', 'Xuanjing Huang', 'Jing Shao']","Safety concerns of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gradually become an important problem in various applications. Surprisingly, previous works indicate a counterintuitive phenomenon that using textual unlearning to align MLLMs achieves comparable safety performances with MLLMs aligned with image text pairs. To explain such a phenomenon, we discover a Visual Safety Information Leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety benchmarks, i.e., the potentially risky content in the image has been revealed in the textual query. Thus, MLLMs can easily refuse these sensitive image-text pairs according to textual queries only, leading to unreliable cross-modality safety evaluation of MLLMs. We also conduct a further comparison experiment between textual alignment and multimodal alignment to highlight this drawback. To this end, we construct multimodal Visual Leakless Safety Bench (VLSBench) with 2.2k image-text pairs through an automated data pipeline. Experimental results indicate that VLSBench poses a significant challenge to both open-source and close-source MLLMs, e.g., LLaVA, Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o. Besides, we empirically compare textual and multimodal alignment methods on VLSBench and find that textual alignment is effective enough for multimodal safety scenarios with VSIL, while multimodal alignment is preferable for safety scenarios without VSIL.

Additionally, when looking at word-level and syntactic learning trajectories, we find that both processes are separable in character LMs. Word learning happens before syntactic learning, whereas both occur simultaneously in subword LMs. This raises questions about the adequacy of subword LMs for modeling language acquisition and positions character LMs as a viable alternative to study processes below the syntactic level.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12835v2
Data Laundering: Artificially Boosting Benchmark Results through Knowledge Distillation,"['Jonibek Mansurov', 'Akhmed Sakip', 'Alham Fikri Aji']","In this paper, we show that knowledge distillation can be subverted to manipulate language model benchmark scores, revealing a critical vulnerability in current evaluation practices. We introduce ""Data Laundering,"" a process that enables the covert transfer of benchmark-specific knowledge through seemingly legitimate intermediate training steps.

Notably, this method can be exploited intentionally or even unintentionally, as researchers may inadvertently adopt this method and inflate scores without realising the implications. While our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we present them as a cautionary tale highlighting the urgent need for more robust evaluation methods in AI.

We propose a scalable weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that effectively transfers episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs. This framework integrates Monte Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a novel distillation method, preserving the inherent LM capabilities while embedding episodic memory. Experiments demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art proprietary LMs by 3.45% across diverse planning and question-answering tasks.

Specifically, we compare the performance of standard LLMs, LLMs augmented with retrievals from a bespoke knowledge base (i.e., KB grounding), and LLMs augmented with retrievals from a web search (i.e., search grounding) on multiple cultural awareness benchmarks. We find that search grounding significantly improves the LLM performance on multiple-choice benchmarks that test propositional knowledge (e.g., cultural norms, artifacts, and institutions), while KB grounding's effectiveness is limited by inadequate knowledge base coverage and a suboptimal retriever. However, search grounding also increases the risk of stereotypical judgments by language models and fails to improve evaluators' judgments of cultural familiarity in a human evaluation with adequate statistical power. These results highlight the distinction between propositional cultural knowledge and open-ended cultural fluency when it comes to evaluating LLMs' cultural awareness.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13497v3
Attacking Vision-Language Computer Agents via Pop-ups,"['Yanzhe Zhang', 'Tao Yu', 'Diyi Yang']","Autonomous agents powered by large vision and language models (VLM) have demonstrated significant potential in completing daily computer tasks, such as browsing the web to book travel and operating desktop software, which requires agents to understand these interfaces. Despite such visual inputs becoming more integrated into agentic applications, what types of risks and attacks exist around them still remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that VLM agents can be easily attacked by a set of carefully designed adversarial pop-ups, which human users would typically recognize and ignore. This distraction leads agents to click these pop-ups instead of performing their tasks as usual. Integrating these pop-ups into existing agent testing environments like OSWorld and VisualWebArena leads to an attack success rate (the frequency of the agent clicking the pop-ups) of 86% on average and decreases the task success rate by 47%. Basic defense techniques, such as asking the agent to ignore pop-ups or including an advertisement notice, are ineffective against the attack.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02391v2

External memory mechanisms have been proposed to address this limitation, enabling LLMs to maintain conversational continuity. However, existing approaches struggle with two key challenges. First, rigid memory granularity fails to capture the natural semantic structure of conversations, leading to fragmented and incomplete representations. Second, fixed retrieval mechanisms cannot adapt to diverse dialogue contexts and user interaction patterns. In this work, we propose Reflective Memory Management (RMM), a novel mechanism for long-term dialogue agents, integrating forward- and backward-looking reflections: (1) Prospective Reflection, which dynamically summarizes interactions across granularities-utterances, turns, and sessions-into a personalized memory bank for effective future retrieval, and (2) Retrospective Reflection, which iteratively refines the retrieval in an online reinforcement learning (RL) manner based on LLMs' cited evidence. Experiments show that RMM demonstrates consistent improvement across various metrics and benchmarks. For example, RMM shows more than 10% accuracy improvement over the baseline without memory management on the LongMemEval dataset.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08026v1

We conduct experiments with various RAG components, including retrieval models, rewriting methods, rerankers, language models, and prompting strategies, and reveal hidden trade-offs in performance of RAG systems.

Self-Error-Instruct: Generalizing from Errors for LLMs Mathematical Reasoning,"['Erxin Yu', 'Jing Li', 'Ming Liao', 'Qi Zhu', 'Boyang XUE', 'Minghui Xu', 'Baojun Wang', 'Lanqing HONG', 'Fei Mi', 'Lifeng Shang']","Although large language models demonstrate strong performance across various domains, they still struggle with numerous bad cases in mathematical reasoning. Previous approaches to learning from errors synthesize training data by solely extrapolating from isolated bad cases, thereby failing to generalize the extensive patterns inherent within these cases. This paper presents Self-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses and synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we explore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to pinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on the instructor model's (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering these keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for each identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which synthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new data is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the most effective examples are kept. Finally, we use these curated data to fine-tune the target model, iteratively repeating the process to enhance performance. We apply our framework to various models and observe improvements in their reasoning abilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematics datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-error instruction in improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning through error generalization.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22591v1

With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics: Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to evaluate LLM generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations.

To evaluate the quality of feedback comments, we apply a novel feedback comment quality evaluation framework.

SEUF: Is Unlearning One Expert Enough for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs?,"['Haomin Zhuang', 'Yihua Zhang', 'Kehan Guo', 'Jinghan Jia', 'Gaowen Liu', 'Sijia Liu', 'Xiangliang Zhang']","Recent advancements in LLMs unlearning have shown remarkable success in removing unwanted data-model influences while preserving the model's utility for legitimate knowledge. Despite these strides, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs--a key subset of the LLM family--have remained unexplored in the context of unlearning. As MoE LLMs are celebrated for their exceptional performance, we ask:How can unlearning be performed effectively and efficiently on MoE LLMs? Our pilot study shows that the dynamic routing nature of MoE LLMs introduces unique challenges, leading to excessive forgetting, uncontrolled knowledge erasure and substantial utility drops when existing unlearning methods are applied. To address this, we propose a novel Selected-Expert Unlearning Framework (SEUF). Through expert attribution, unlearning is concentrated on the most actively engaged experts for the specified knowledge. Concurrently, an anchor loss is applied to the router to stabilize the active state of this targeted expert, ensuring focused and controlled unlearning. SEUF is compatible with various standard unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEUF enhances both forget quality up to 5% and model utility by 35% on MoE LLMs across various benchmarks and LLM architectures (compared to standard unlearning algorithms), while only unlearning 0.06% of the model parameters.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18797v2

This study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback.

However, these methods often depend on predefined intermediate formats and annotated data, limiting their scalability and generalizability. In this work, we introduce a task-agnostic framework that enables models to generate intermediate ""warmup"" sequences. These warmup sequences, serving as an initial state for subsequent generation, are optimized to enhance the probability of generating the target sequence without relying on external supervision or human-designed structures. Drawing inspiration from reinforcement learning principles, our method iteratively refines these intermediate steps to maximize their contribution to the final output, similar to reward-driven optimization in reinforcement learning with human feedback. Experimental results across tasks such as translation, summarization, and multi-choice question answering for logical reasoning show that our approach outperforms traditional SFT methods, and offers a scalable and flexible solution for sequence-to-sequence tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12304v1

Rigorous data collection and labeling practices are essential for developing more human-centered and socially aware technologies. Although there has been growing interest in under-resourced languages within the NLP community, work in this area faces unique challenges, such as data scarcity and limited access to qualified annotators. In this paper, we collect feedback from individuals directly involved in and impacted by NLP artefacts for medium- and low-resource languages. We conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses of their responses and highlight key issues related to: (1) data quality, including linguistic and cultural appropriateness; and (2) the ethics of common annotation practices, such as the misuse of participatory research. Based on these findings, we make several recommendations for creating high-quality language artefacts that reflect the cultural milieu of their speakers, while also respecting the dignity and labor of data workers.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12691v6

This setting, in which the model must generate the missing quotation, mirrors the human process of literary analysis by requiring models to perform both global narrative reasoning and close textual examination. We curate a high-quality subset of 292 examples through extensive filtering and human verification. Our experiments show that recent reasoning models, such as Gemini Pro 2.5 can exceed human expert performance (62.5% vs. 50% accuracy). In contrast, the best open-weight model achieves only 29.1% accuracy, highlighting a wide gap in interpretive reasoning between open and closed-weight models.

Given proficiency at arbitrary levels of granularity, SkillVerse is flexible to produce insights of behaviors of modern large models. We also demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream tasks: 1) improving model in-context learning by 25% using a tree-search algorithm to select more informative few-shot demonstrations, and 2) accurately predicting new model weaknesses with a 55% success rate, 22% higher than without SkillVerse.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00319v1
CypherBench: Towards Precise Retrieval over Full-scale Modern Knowledge Graphs in the LLM Era,"['Yanlin Feng', 'Simone Papicchio', 'Sajjadur Rahman']","Retrieval from graph data is crucial for augmenting large language models (LLM) with both open-domain knowledge and private enterprise data, and it is also a key component in the recent GraphRAG system (edge et al., 2024). Despite decades of research on knowledge graphs and knowledge base question answering, leading LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain and LlamaIndex) have only minimal support for retrieval from modern encyclopedic knowledge graphs like Wikidata. In this paper, we analyze the root cause and suggest that modern RDF knowledge graphs (e.g. Wikidata, Freebase) are less efficient for LLMs due to overly large schemas that far exceed the typical LLM context window, use of resource identifiers, overlapping relation types and lack of normalization. As a solution, we propose property graph views on top of the underlying RDF graph that can be efficiently queried by LLMs using Cypher. We instantiated this idea on Wikidata and introduced CypherBench, the first benchmark with 11 large-scale, multi-domain property graphs with 7.8 million entities and over 10,000 questions. To achieve this, we tackled several key challenges, including developing an RDF-to-property graph conversion engine, creating a systematic pipeline for text-to-Cypher task generation, and designing new evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18702v2

While social media platforms offer rich data for mental health screening, computational approaches often bypass these established clinical assessment tools in favor of black-box classification. We propose a novel questionnaire-guided screening framework that bridges psychological practice and computational methods through adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (\textit{aRAG}). Our approach links unstructured social media content and standardized clinical assessments by retrieving relevant posts for each questionnaire item and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to complete validated psychological instruments. Our findings demonstrate two key advantages of questionnaire-guided screening: First, when completing the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), our approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance on Reddit-based benchmarks without requiring training data. Second, we show that guiding LLMs through standardized questionnaires can yield superior results compared to directly prompting them for depression screening, while also providing a more interpretable assessment by linking model outputs to clinically validated diagnostic criteria. Additionally, we show, as a proof-of-concept, how our questionnaire-based methodology can be extended to other mental conditions' screening, highlighting the promising role of LLMs as psychological assessors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00982v2

Our experiments show that across a wide range of scenarios and LLM architectures, interactive learning consistently enhances performance, achieving up to a 25% improvement, with 'cold-start' student models matching static learning baselines in as few as five dialogue turns. Interactive setups can also mitigate the disadvantages of weaker teachers, showcasing the robustness of question-driven learning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11388v2
Circuit Stability Characterizes Language Model Generalization,['Alan Sun'],"Extensively evaluating the capabilities of (large) language models is difficult. Rapid development of state-of-the-art models induce benchmark saturation, while creating more challenging datasets is labor-intensive. Inspired by the recent developments in mechanistic interpretability, we introduce circuit stability as a new way to assess model performance. Circuit stability refers to a model's ability to apply a consistent reasoning process-its circuit-across various inputs. We mathematically formalize circuit stability and circuit equivalence. Then, through three case studies, we empirically show that circuit stability and the lack thereof can characterize and predict different aspects of generalization. Our proposed methods offer a step towards rigorously relating the generality of models to their interpretability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24731v1

These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the syntactic behavior of LLMs as well as humans, within the NYT genre.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01407v1
Improving Preference Extraction In LLMs By Identifying Latent Knowledge Through Classifying Probes,"['Sharan Maiya', 'Yinhong Liu', 'Ramit Debnath', 'Anna Korhonen']","Large Language Models (LLMs) are often used as automated judges to evaluate text, but their effectiveness can be hindered by various unintentional biases. We propose using linear classifying probes, trained by leveraging differences between contrasting pairs of prompts, to directly access LLMs' latent knowledge and extract more accurate preferences. Through extensive experiments using models of varying size from four different families and six diverse datasets assessing text quality evaluation and common sense reasoning, we demonstrate that both supervised and unsupervised probing approaches consistently outperform traditional generation-based judgement while maintaining similar computational costs. These probes generalise under domain shifts and can even outperform finetuned evaluators with the same training data size. Our results suggest linear probing offers an accurate, robust and computationally efficient approach for LLM-as-judge tasks while providing interpretable insights into how models encode judgement-relevant knowledge. Our data and code will be openly released in the future.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17755v1
"White Men Lead, Black Women Help? Benchmarking and Mitigating Language Agency Social Biases in LLMs","['Yixin Wan', 'Kai-Wei Chang']","Social biases can manifest in language agency. However, very limited research has investigated such biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content. In addition, previous works often rely on string-matching techniques to identify agentic and communal words within texts, falling short of accurately classifying language agency. We introduce the Language Agency Bias Evaluation (LABE) benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates biases in LLMs by analyzing agency levels attributed to different demographic groups in model generations. LABE tests for gender, racial, and intersectional language agency biases in LLMs on 3 text generation tasks: biographies, professor reviews, and reference letters. Using LABE, we unveil language agency social biases in 3 recent LLMs: ChatGPT, Llama3, and Mistral. We observe that: (1) LLM generations tend to demonstrate greater gender bias than human-written texts; (2) Models demonstrate remarkably higher levels of intersectional bias than the other bias aspects. (3) Prompt-based mitigation is unstable and frequently leads to bias exacerbation. Based on our observations, we propose Mitigation via Selective Rewrite (MSR), a novel bias mitigation strategy that leverages an agency classifier to identify and selectively revise parts of generated texts that demonstrate communal traits. Empirical results prove MSR to be more effective and reliable than prompt-based mitigation method, showing a promising research direction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10508v5
AIMSCheck: Leveraging LLMs for AI-Assisted Review of Modern Slavery Statements Across Jurisdictions,"['Adriana Eufrosina Bora', 'Akshatha Arodi', 'Duoyi Zhang', 'Jordan Bannister', 'Mirko Bronzi', 'Arsene Fansi Tchango', 'Md Abul Bashar', 'Richi Nayak', 'Kerrie Mengersen']","Modern Slavery Acts mandate that corporations disclose their efforts to combat modern slavery, aiming to enhance transparency and strengthen practices for its eradication. However, verifying these statements remains challenging due to their complex, diversified language and the sheer number of statements that must be reviewed. The development of NLP tools to assist in this task is also difficult due to a scarcity of annotated data. Furthermore, as modern slavery transparency legislation has been introduced in several countries, the generalizability of such tools across legal jurisdictions must be studied. To address these challenges, we work with domain experts to make two key contributions. First, we present AIMS.uk and AIMS.ca, newly annotated datasets from the UK and Canada to enable cross-jurisdictional evaluation. Second, we introduce AIMSCheck, an end-to-end framework for compliance validation. AIMSCheck decomposes the compliance assessment task into three levels, enhancing interpretability and practical applicability. Our experiments show that models trained on an Australian dataset generalize well across UK and Canadian jurisdictions, demonstrating the potential for broader application in compliance monitoring. We release the benchmark datasets and AIMSCheck to the public to advance AI-adoption in compliance assessment and drive further research in this field.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01671v1
"Collapse of Dense Retrievers: Short, Early, and Literal Biases Outranking Factual Evidence","['Mohsen Fayyaz', 'Ali Modarressi', 'Hinrich Schuetze', 'Nanyun Peng']","Dense retrieval models are commonly used in Information Retrieval (IR) applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Since they often serve as the first step in these systems, their robustness is critical to avoid downstream failures. In this work, we repurpose a relation extraction dataset (e.g., Re-DocRED) to design controlled experiments that quantify the impact of heuristic biases, such as a preference for shorter documents, on retrievers like Dragon+ and Contriever. We uncover major vulnerabilities, showing retrievers favor shorter documents, early positions, repeated entities, and literal matches, all while ignoring the answer's presence! Notably, when multiple biases combine, models exhibit catastrophic performance degradation, selecting the answer-containing document in less than 10% of cases over a synthetic biased document without the answer. Furthermore, we show that these biases have direct consequences for downstream applications like RAG, where retrieval-preferred documents can mislead LLMs, resulting in a 34% performance drop than providing no documents at all. https://huggingface.co/datasets/mohsenfayyaz/ColDeR",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05037v2
SelfElicit: Your Language Model Secretly Knows Where is the Relevant Evidence,"['Zhining Liu', 'Rana Ali Amjad', 'Ravinarayana Adkathimar', 'Tianxin Wei', 'Hanghang Tong']","Providing Language Models (LMs) with relevant evidence in the context (either via retrieval or user-provided) can significantly improve their ability to provide better-grounded responses. However, recent studies have found that LMs often struggle to fully comprehend and utilize key evidence from the context, especially when it contains noise and irrelevant information, an issue common in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose SelfElicit, an inference-time approach that helps LMs focus on key contextual evidence through self-guided explicit highlighting. By leveraging the inherent evidence-finding capabilities of LMs using the attention scores of deeper layers, our method automatically identifies and emphasizes key evidence within the input context, facilitating more accurate and grounded responses without additional training or iterative prompting. We demonstrate that SelfElicit brings consistent and significant improvement on multiple evidence-based QA tasks for various LM families while maintaining computational efficiency.

The Male CEO and the Female Assistant: Evaluation and Mitigation of Gender Biases in Text-To-Image Generation of Dual Subjects,"['Yixin Wan', 'Kai-Wei Chang']","Recent large-scale T2I models like DALLE-3 have made progress in reducing gender stereotypes when generating single-person images. However, significant biases remain when generating images with more than one person. To systematically evaluate this, we propose the Paired Stereotype Test (PST) framework, which queries T2I models to depict two individuals assigned with male-stereotyped and female-stereotyped social identities, respectively (e.g. ""a CEO"" and ""an Assistant""). This contrastive setting often triggers T2I models to generate gender-stereotyped images. Using PST, we evaluate two aspects of gender biases -- the well-known bias in gendered occupation and a novel aspect: bias in organizational power. Experiments show that over 74\% images generated by DALLE-3 display gender-occupational biases. Additionally, compared to single-person settings, DALLE-3 is more likely to perpetuate male-associated stereotypes under PST. We further propose FairCritic, a novel and interpretable framework that leverages an LLM-based critic model to i) detect bias in generated images, and ii) adaptively provide feedback to T2I models for improving fairness. FairCritic achieves near-perfect fairness on PST, overcoming the limitations of previous prompt-based intervention approaches.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11089v4
A Little Human Data Goes A Long Way,"['Dhananjay Ashok', 'Jonathan May']","Faced with an expensive human annotation process, creators of NLP systems increasingly turn to synthetic data generation. While this method shows promise, the extent to which synthetic data can replace human annotation is poorly understood. We investigate the use of synthetic data in Fact Verification (FV) and Question Answering (QA) by studying the effects of incrementally replacing human generated data with synthetic points on eight diverse datasets. Strikingly, replacing up to 90% of the training data only marginally decreases performance, but replacing the final 10% leads to severe declines. We find that models trained on purely synthetic data can be reliably improved by including as few as 125 human generated data points. We show that matching the performance gain of just a little additional human data (only 200 points) requires an order of magnitude more synthetic data and estimate price ratios at which human annotation would be a more cost-effective solution. Our results suggest that even when human annotation at scale is infeasible, there is great value to having a small proportion of the dataset being human generated.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13098v2
Mitigating Shortcut Learning with InterpoLated Learning,"['Michalis Korakakis', 'Andreas Vlachos', 'Adrian Weller']","Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts, i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples. Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's broad applicability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05527v1

We show that 6% of Alpaca dataset selected with DavIR can steer both the LLaMA and Gemma model family to produce superior performance compared to the same models trained on the full 52K dataset. We also show that Alpaca dataset compressed with DavIR can be combined with GSM8K dataset to effectively balance open-domain freeform QA and mathematical reasoning capabilities.

BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary units of computation. Patches are segmented based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating more compute and model capacity where increased data complexity demands it. We present the first FLOP controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters and 4T training bytes. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling models trained on raw bytes without a fixed vocabulary. Both training and inference efficiency improve due to dynamically selecting long patches when data is predictable, along with qualitative improvements on reasoning and long tail generalization. Overall, for fixed inference costs, BLT shows significantly better scaling than tokenization-based models, by simultaneously growing both patch and model size.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09871v1
DiffuseDef: Improved Robustness to Adversarial Attacks via Iterative Denoising,"['Zhenhao Li', 'Huichi Zhou', 'Marek Rei', 'Lucia Specia']","Pretrained language models have significantly advanced performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, adversarial attacks continue to pose a critical challenge to systems built using these models, as they can be exploited with carefully crafted adversarial texts. Inspired by the ability of diffusion models to predict and reduce noise in computer vision, we propose a novel and flexible adversarial defense method for language classification tasks, DiffuseDef, which incorporates a diffusion layer as a denoiser between the encoder and the classifier. The diffusion layer is trained on top of the existing classifier, ensuring seamless integration with any model in a plug-and-play manner. During inference, the adversarial hidden state is first combined with sampled noise, then denoised iteratively and finally ensembled to produce a robust text representation. By integrating adversarial training, denoising, and ensembling techniques, we show that DiffuseDef improves over existing adversarial defense methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance against common black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00248v2

LLMs + Persona-Plug = Personalized LLMs,"['Jiongnan Liu', 'Yutao Zhu', 'Shuting Wang', 'Xiaochi Wei', 'Erxue Min', 'Yu Lu', 'Shuaiqiang Wang', 'Dawei Yin', 'Zhicheng Dou']","Personalization plays a critical role in numerous language tasks and applications, since users with the same requirements may prefer diverse outputs based on their individual interests. This has led to the development of various personalized approaches aimed at adapting large language models (LLMs) to generate customized outputs aligned with user preferences. Some of them involve fine-tuning a unique personalized LLM for each user, which is too expensive for widespread application. Alternative approaches introduce personalization information in a plug-and-play manner by retrieving the user's relevant historical texts as demonstrations. However, this retrieval-based strategy may break the continuity of the user history and fail to capture the user's overall styles and patterns, hence leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel personalized LLM model, \ours{}. It constructs a user-specific embedding for each individual by modeling all her historical contexts through a lightweight plug-in user embedder module. By attaching this embedding to the task input, LLMs can better understand and capture user habits and preferences, thereby producing more personalized outputs without tuning their own parameters. Extensive experiments on various tasks in the language model personalization (LaMP) benchmark demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing personalized LLM approaches.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11901v1
Developmentally-plausible Working Memory Shapes a Critical Period for Language Acquisition,"['Masato Mita', 'Ryo Yoshida', 'Yohei Oseki']","Large language models possess general linguistic abilities but acquire language less efficiently than humans. This study proposes a method for integrating the developmental characteristics of working memory during the critical period, a stage when human language acquisition is particularly efficient, into the training process of language models. The proposed method introduces a mechanism that initially constrains working memory during the early stages of training and gradually relaxes this constraint in an exponential manner as learning progresses. Targeted syntactic evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods without memory constraints or with static memory constraints. These findings not only provide new directions for designing data-efficient language models but also offer indirect evidence supporting the role of the developmental characteristics of working memory as the underlying mechanism of the critical period in language acquisition.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04795v3

Does Context Matter? ContextualJudgeBench for Evaluating LLM-based Judges in Contextual Settings,"['Austin Xu', 'Srijan Bansal', 'Yifei Ming', 'Semih Yavuz', 'Shafiq Joty']","The large language model (LLM)-as-judge paradigm has been used to meet the demand for a cheap, reliable, and fast evaluation of model outputs during AI system development and post-deployment monitoring. While judge models -- LLMs finetuned to specialize in assessing and critiquing model outputs -- have been touted as general purpose evaluators, they are typically evaluated only on non-contextual scenarios, such as instruction following. The omission of contextual settings -- those where external information is used as context to generate an output -- is surprising given the increasing prevalence of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases. Contextual assessment is uniquely challenging, as evaluation often depends on practitioner priorities, leading to conditional evaluation criteria (e.g., comparing responses based on factuality and then considering completeness if they are equally factual). To address the gap, we propose ContextualJudgeBench, a judge benchmark with 2,000 challenging response pairs across eight splits inspired by real-world contextual evaluation scenarios. We build our benchmark with a multi-pronged data construction pipeline that leverages both existing human annotations and model-based perturbations. Our comprehensive study across 11 judge models and 9 general purpose models, reveals that the contextual information and its assessment criteria present a significant challenge to even state-of-the-art models.

Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which well-alignment models can easily block.

In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based strategies to elicit target PII.

Which features of the formal language impart an inductive bias that leads to effective transfer? Drawing on insights from linguistics and complexity theory, we hypothesize that effective transfer occurs when two conditions are met: the formal language should capture the dependency structures present in natural language, and it should remain within the computational limitations of the model architecture. We experiment with pre-pretraining (training on formal language before natural languages) on transformers and find that formal languages capturing hierarchical dependencies indeed enable language models to achieve lower loss on natural language and better linguistic generalization compared to other formal languages. We also find modest support for the hypothesis that the formal language should fall within the computational limitations of the architecture. Strikingly, pre-pretraining reduces loss more efficiently than training on a matched amount of natural language. For a 1B-parameter language model trained on roughly 1.6B tokens of natural language, pre-pretraining achieves the same loss and better linguistic generalization with a 33% smaller token budget. Finally, we also give mechanistic evidence of transfer from formal to natural language: attention heads acquired during pre-pretraining remain crucial for the model's performance on syntactic evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19249v2

To investigate this challenge, we first present a controlled testbed featuring four distinct knowledge access scenarios, including the aforementioned edge case, revealing that conventional LLM usage exhibits insufficient robustness in handling all instances. Addressing this limitation, we propose Contrastive Decoding with Abstention (CDA), a novel training-free decoding method that allows LLMs to generate responses when relevant knowledge is available and to abstain otherwise. CDA estimates the relevance of both knowledge sources for a given input, adaptively deciding which type of information to prioritize and which to exclude.

On the Risk of Evidence Pollution for Malicious Social Text Detection in the Era of LLMs,"['Herun Wan', 'Minnan Luo', 'Zhixiong Su', 'Guang Dai', 'Xiang Zhao']","Evidence-enhanced detectors present remarkable abilities in identifying malicious social text. However, the rise of large language models (LLMs) brings potential risks of evidence pollution to confuse detectors. This paper explores potential manipulation scenarios including basic pollution, and rephrasing or generating evidence by LLMs. To mitigate the negative impact, we propose three defense strategies from the data and model sides, including machine-generated text detection, a mixture of experts, and parameter updating. Extensive experiments on four malicious social text detection tasks with ten datasets illustrate that evidence pollution significantly compromises detectors, where the generating strategy causes up to a 14.4% performance drop. Meanwhile, the defense strategies could mitigate evidence pollution, but they faced limitations for practical employment. Further analysis illustrates that polluted evidence (i) is of high quality, evaluated by metrics and humans; (ii) would compromise the model calibration, increasing expected calibration error up to 21.6%; and (iii) could be integrated to amplify the negative impact, especially for encoder-based LMs, where the accuracy drops by 21.8%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12600v2

"If Attention Serves as a Cognitive Model of Human Memory Retrieval, What is the Plausible Memory Representation?","['Ryo Yoshida', 'Shinnosuke Isono', 'Kohei Kajikawa', 'Taiga Someya', 'Yushi Sugimoto', 'Yohei Oseki']","Recent work in computational psycholinguistics has revealed intriguing parallels between attention mechanisms and human memory retrieval, focusing primarily on vanilla Transformers that operate on token-level representations. However, computational psycholinguistic research has also established that syntactic structures provide compelling explanations for human sentence processing that token-level factors cannot fully account for. In this paper, we investigate whether the attention mechanism of Transformer Grammar (TG), which uniquely operates on syntactic structures as representational units, can serve as a cognitive model of human memory retrieval, using Normalized Attention Entropy (NAE) as a linking hypothesis between models and humans. Our experiments demonstrate that TG's attention achieves superior predictive power for self-paced reading times compared to vanilla Transformer's, with further analyses revealing independent contributions from both models. These findings suggest that human sentence processing involves dual memory representations -- one based on syntactic structures and another on token sequences -- with attention serving as the general memory retrieval algorithm, while highlighting the importance of incorporating syntactic structures as representational units.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11469v2
Aligning VLM Assistants with Personalized Situated Cognition,"['Yongqi Li', 'Shen Zhou', 'Xiaohu Li', 'Xin Miao', 'Jintao Wen', 'Mayi Xu', 'Jianhao Chen', 'Birong Pan', 'Hankun Kang', 'Yuanyuan Zhu', 'Ming Zhong', 'Tieyun Qian']","Vision-language models (VLMs) aligned with general human objectives, such as being harmless and hallucination-free, have become valuable assistants of humans in managing visual tasks. However, people with diversified backgrounds have different cognition even in the same situation. Consequently, they may have personalized expectations for VLM assistants. This highlights the urgent need to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition for real-world assistance. To study this problem, we first simplify it by characterizing individuals based on the sociological concept of Role-Set. Then, we propose to evaluate the individuals' actions to examine whether the personalized alignment is achieved. Further, we construct a benchmark named PCogAlignBench, which includes 18k instances and 20 individuals with different Role-Sets. Finally, we present a framework called PCogAlign, which constructs a cognition-aware and action-based reward model for personalized alignment. Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate the reliability of the PCogAlignBench and the effectiveness of our proposed PCogAlign. We will open-source the constructed benchmark and code at https://github.com/NLPGM/PCogAlign.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00930v1
Attention Entropy is a Key Factor: An Analysis of Parallel Context Encoding with Full-attention-based Pre-trained Language Models,"['Zhisong Zhang', 'Yan Wang', 'Xinting Huang', 'Tianqing Fang', 'Hongming Zhang', 'Chenlong Deng', 'Shuaiyi Li', 'Dong Yu']","Large language models have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of language tasks, owing to their exceptional capabilities in context modeling. The most commonly used method of context modeling is full self-attention, as seen in standard decoder-only Transformers. Although powerful, this method can be inefficient for long sequences and may overlook inherent input structures. To address these problems, an alternative approach is parallel context encoding, which splits the context into sub-pieces and encodes them parallelly. Because parallel patterns are not encountered during training, naively applying parallel encoding leads to performance degradation. However, the underlying reasons and potential mitigations are unclear. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of this issue and identify that unusually high attention entropy can be a key factor. Furthermore, we adopt two straightforward methods to reduce attention entropy by incorporating attention sinks and selective mechanisms. Experiments on various tasks reveal that these methods effectively lower irregular attention entropy and narrow performance gaps. We hope this study can illuminate ways to enhance context modeling mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16545v2

Selecting and Merging: Towards Adaptable and Scalable Named Entity Recognition with Large Language Models,"['Zhuojun Ding', 'Wei Wei', 'Chenghao Fan']","Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models (LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically, for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii) performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights into potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our framework.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22813v1
Embracing Imperfection: Simulating Students with Diverse Cognitive Levels Using LLM-based Agents,"['Tao Wu', 'Jingyuan Chen', 'Wang Lin', 'Mengze Li', 'Yumeng Zhu', 'Ang Li', 'Kun Kuang', 'Fei Wu']","Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing education, with LLM-based agents playing a key role in simulating student behavior. A major challenge in student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful assistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these predictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better replicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the \texttt{Student\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python programming and $5,000$ learning records. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving $100\%$ improvement in simulation accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19997v1

In practical design workflows, designers often engage in time-consuming reviews and refinements of these prototypes by comparing them with reference images. To bridge this gap, we introduce the CAD review task to automatically detect and correct potential errors, ensuring consistency between the constructed 3D objects and reference images. However, recent advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to recognize multiple geometric components and perform spatial geometric operations within the CAD program, leading to inaccurate reviews. In this paper, we propose the CAD program repairer (ReCAD) framework to effectively detect program errors and provide helpful feedback on error correction. Additionally, we create a dataset, CADReview, consisting of over 20K program-image pairs, with diverse errors for the CAD review task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReCAD significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, which shows great potential in design applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22304v1

EfficientQAT: Efficient Quantization-Aware Training for Large Language Models,"['Mengzhao Chen', 'Wenqi Shao', 'Peng Xu', 'Jiahao Wang', 'Peng Gao', 'Kaipeng Zhang', 'Ping Luo']","Large language models (LLMs) are crucial in modern natural language processing and artificial intelligence. However, they face challenges in managing their significant memory requirements. Although quantization-aware training (QAT) offers a solution by reducing memory consumption through low-bit representations with minimal accuracy loss, it is impractical due to substantial training resources. To address this, we propose Efficient Quantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm. EfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all parameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters (E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable direct training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy loss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization. E2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end, further improving the performance of quantized models by considering interactions among all sub-modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of models, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with scales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance, EfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41 hours, with less than 3 points accuracy degradation compared to the full precision (69.48 vs. 72.41).

Exploring How Generative MLLMs Perceive More Than CLIP with the Same Vision Encoder,"['Siting Li', 'Pang Wei Koh', 'Simon Shaolei Du']","Recent research has shown that CLIP models struggle with visual reasoning tasks that require grounding compositionality, understanding spatial relationships, or capturing fine-grained details. One natural hypothesis is that the CLIP vision encoder does not embed essential information for these tasks. However, we find that this is not always the case: The encoder gathers query-relevant visual information, while CLIP fails to extract it. In particular, we show that another branch of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieve significantly higher accuracy than CLIP in many of these tasks using the same vision encoder and weights, indicating that these Generative MLLMs perceive more -- as they extract and utilize visual information more effectively. We conduct a series of controlled experiments and reveal that their success is attributed to multiple key design choices, including patch tokens, position embeddings, and prompt-based weighting. On the other hand, enhancing the training data alone or applying a stronger text encoder does not suffice to solve the task, and additional text tokens offer little benefit. Interestingly, we find that fine-grained visual reasoning is not exclusive to generative models trained by an autoregressive loss: When converted into CLIP-like encoders by contrastive finetuning, these MLLMs still outperform CLIP under the same cosine similarity-based evaluation protocol. Our study highlights the importance of VLM architectural choices and suggests directions for improving the performance of CLIP-like contrastive VLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05195v2
NexusSum: Hierarchical LLM Agents for Long-Form Narrative Summarization,"['Hyuntak Kim', 'Byung-Hak Kim']","Summarizing long-form narratives--such as books, movies, and TV scripts--requires capturing intricate plotlines, character interactions, and thematic coherence, a task that remains challenging for existing LLMs. We introduce NexusSum, a multi-agent LLM framework for narrative summarization that processes long-form text through a structured, sequential pipeline--without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Dialogue-to-Description Transformation: A narrative-specific preprocessing method that standardizes character dialogue and descriptive text into a unified format, improving coherence. (2) Hierarchical Multi-LLM Summarization: A structured summarization pipeline that optimizes chunk processing and controls output length for accurate, high-quality summaries.

DenseLoRA: Dense Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models,"['Lin Mu', 'Xiaoyu Wang', 'Li Ni', 'Yang Li', 'Zhize Wu', 'Peiquan Jin', 'Yiwen Zhang']","Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been developed as an efficient approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning two low-rank matrices, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, prior research indicates that many of the weights in these matrices are redundant, leading to inefficiencies in parameter utilization. To address this limitation, we introduce Dense Low-Rank Adaptation (DenseLoRA), a novel approach that enhances parameter efficiency while achieving superior performance compared to LoRA. DenseLoRA builds upon the concept of representation fine-tuning, incorporating a single Encoder-Decoder to refine and compress hidden representations across all adaptation layers before applying adaptation. Instead of relying on two redundant low-rank matrices as in LoRA, DenseLoRA adapts LLMs through a dense low-rank matrix, improving parameter utilization and adaptation efficiency. We evaluate DenseLoRA on various benchmarks, showing that it achieves 83.8% accuracy with only 0.01% of trainable parameters, compared to LoRA's 80.8% accuracy with 0.70% of trainable parameters on LLaMA3-8B.

Previous research suggests that factual knowledge is stored within multi-layer perceptron weights, and some storage units exhibit degeneracy, referred to as Degenerate Knowledge Neurons (DKNs). Despite the novelty and unique properties of this concept, it has not been rigorously defined or systematically studied. We first consider the connection weight patterns of MLP neurons and define DKNs from both structural and functional aspects. Based on this, we introduce the Neurological Topology Clustering method, which allows the formation of DKNs in any numbers and structures, leading to a more accurate DKN acquisition. Furthermore, inspired by cognitive science, we explore the relationship between DKNs and the robustness, evolvability, and complexity of LLMs. Our execution of 34 experiments under 6 settings demonstrates the connection between DKNs and these three properties.

Towards Context-Robust LLMs: A Gated Representation Fine-tuning Approach,"['Shenglai Zeng', 'Pengfei He', 'Kai Guo', 'Tianqi Zheng', 'Hanqing Lu', 'Yue Xing', 'Hui Liu']","Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with external contexts, such as through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), often face challenges in handling imperfect evidence. They tend to over-rely on external knowledge, making them vulnerable to misleading and unhelpful contexts. To address this, we propose the concept of context-robust LLMs, which can effectively balance internal knowledge with external context, similar to human cognitive processes. Specifically, context-robust LLMs should rely on external context only when lacking internal knowledge, identify contradictions between internal and external knowledge, and disregard unhelpful contexts. To achieve this goal, we introduce Grft, a lightweight and plug-and-play gated representation fine-tuning approach. Grft consists of two key components: a gating mechanism to detect and filter problematic inputs, and low-rank representation adapters to adjust hidden representations. By training a lightweight intervention function with only 0.0004\% of model size on fewer than 200 examples, Grft can effectively adapt LLMs towards context-robust behaviors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14100v2

This paper investigates \emph{data-centric interpretability} in language models, focusing on the next-word prediction task. Using representer theorem, we identify two types of \emph{support samples}-those that either promote or deter specific predictions. Our findings reveal that being a support sample is an intrinsic property, predictable even before training begins. Additionally, while non-support samples are less influential in direct predictions, they play a critical role in preventing overfitting and shaping generalization and representation learning. Notably, the importance of non-support samples increases in deeper layers, suggesting their significant role in intermediate representation formation. These insights shed light on the interplay between data and model decisions, offering a new dimension to understanding language model behavior and interpretability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04047v2

From Trade-off to Synergy: A Versatile Symbiotic Watermarking Framework for Large Language Models,"['Yidan Wang', 'Yubing Ren', 'Yanan Cao', 'Binxing Fang']","The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about the misuse of AI-generated text, making watermarking a promising solution. Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models.

With this established, our core findings reveal three key advantages of features over neurons: (1) Features exhibit stronger influence on knowledge expression and superior interpretability. (2) Features demonstrate enhanced monosemanticity, showing distinct activation patterns between related and unrelated facts.

From Real to Synthetic: Synthesizing Millions of Diversified and Complicated User Instructions with Attributed Grounding,"['Chiwei Zhu', 'Benfeng Xu', 'Xiaorui Wang', 'Zhendong Mao']","The pursuit of diverse, complex, and large-scale instruction data is crucial for automatically aligning large language models (LLMs). While there are methods capable of generating synthetic instructions at scale, they either suffer from limited grounding sources, leading to a narrow distribution, or rely on trivial extensions that fail to produce meaningful trajectories in terms of complexity. In contrast, instructions that benefit efficient alignment are typically crafted with cognitive insights and grounded in real-world use cases. In this paper, we synthesize such instructions using attributed grounding, which involves 1) a top-down attribution process that grounds a selective set of real instructions to situated users, and 2) a bottom-up synthesis process that leverages web documents to first generate a situation, then a meaningful instruction. This framework allows us to harvest diverse and complex instructions at scale, utilizing the vast range of web documents.

Great efforts have been made on privacy by building various evaluation benchmarks to study LLMs' privacy awareness and robustness from their generated outputs to their hidden representations. Unfortunately, most of these works adopt a narrow formulation of privacy and only investigate personally identifiable information (PII). In this paper, we follow the merit of the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory, which posits that privacy evaluation should not only cover the transmitted attributes but also encompass the whole relevant social context through private information flows. We present PrivaCI-Bench, a comprehensive contextual privacy evaluation benchmark targeted at legal compliance to cover well-annotated privacy and safety regulations, real court cases, privacy policies, and synthetic data built from the official toolkit to study LLMs' privacy and safety compliance.

ExpeTrans: LLMs Are Experiential Transfer Learners,"['Jinglong Gao', 'Xiao Ding', 'Lingxiao Zou', 'Bibo Cai', 'Bing Qin', 'Ting Liu']","Recent studies provide large language models (LLMs) with textual task-solving experiences via prompts to improve their performance. However, previous methods rely on substantial human labor or time to gather such experiences for each task, which is impractical given the growing variety of task types in user queries to LLMs. To address this issue, we design an autonomous experience transfer framework to explore whether LLMs can mimic human cognitive intelligence to autonomously transfer experience from existing source tasks to newly encountered target tasks. This not only allows the acquisition of experience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel path for the generalization of LLMs. Experimental results on 13 datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively improves the performance of LLMs. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of each module in the framework.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23191v1

In general, the attention scores are determined simply by the key-query products. However, this work's occasional trial (combining DAPE and NoPE) of including additional MLPs on attention scores without position encoding indicates that the classical key-query multiplication may limit the performance of Transformers. In this work, we conceptualize attention as a feature map and apply the convolution operator (for neighboring attention scores across different heads) to mimic the processing methods in computer vision. Specifically, the main contribution of this paper is identifying and interpreting the Transformer length extrapolation problem as a result of the limited expressiveness of the naive query and key dot product, and we successfully translate the length extrapolation issue into a well-understood feature map processing problem. The novel insight, which can be adapted to various attention-related models, reveals that the current Transformer architecture has the potential for further evolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that treating attention as a feature map and applying convolution as a processing method significantly enhances Transformer performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04798v3

Our method is conducted on both coarse and fine granularity. On coarse-granularity, we construct constraint-aware preference data based on instruction decomposition and recombination.

However, this often leads to degraded performance on short-text tasks, while the reasons for this degradation remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we identify two primary factors contributing to this issue: distribution drift in hidden states and attention scores, and catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose Long Context Pre-training with Restoration Distillation (LongReD), a novel approach designed to mitigate short-text performance degradation through minimizing the distribution discrepancy between the extended and original models. Besides training on long texts, LongReD distills the hidden state of selected layers from the original model on short texts. Additionally, LongReD also introduces a short-to-long distillation, aligning the output distribution on short texts with that on long texts by leveraging skipped positional indices. Experiments on common text benchmarks demonstrate that LongReD effectively preserves the model's short-text performance while maintaining comparable or even better capacity to handle long texts than baselines.

To address this, we introduce APB, an efficient long-context inference framework that leverages multi-host approximate attention to enhance prefill speed by reducing compute and enhancing parallelism simultaneously. APB introduces a communication mechanism for essential key-value pairs within a sequence parallelism framework, enabling a faster inference speed while maintaining task performance. We implement APB by incorporating a tailored FlashAttn kernel alongside optimized distribution strategies, supporting diverse models and parallelism configurations.

However, the current study points out that there is a preference gap between retrievers and LLMs in the RAG framework, which limit the further improvement of system performance. Some highly relevant passages may interfere with LLM reasoning because they contain complex or contradictory information; while some indirectly related or even inaccurate content may help LLM generate more accurate answers by providing suggestive information or logical clues. To solve this, we propose GainRAG, a novel approach that aligns the retriever's and LLM's preferences by defining a new metric, ""gain"", which measure how well an input passage contributes to correct outputs.

Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the decoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is crucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two observations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which requires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task; (ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long outputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous strategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and generalization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other prefill-only KV compression methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13649v3

Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts (MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage.

Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from either insufficient privacy protection, performance degradation, or large inference time overhead. To address these limitations, we propose PrivacyRestore, a plug-and-play method to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference. The server first trains restoration vectors for each privacy span and then release to clients. Privacy span is defined as a contiguous sequence of tokens within a text that contain private information. The client then aggregate restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the input into a single meta restoration vector which is later sent to the server side along with the input without privacy spans.The private information is restored via activation steering during inference.

In this paper, we propose a Deep Generative Adaptive Replay (DGAR) method, which can generate and adaptively replay historical entity distribution representations from the whole historical context. To address the first challenge, historical context prompts as sampling units are built to preserve the whole historical context information. To overcome the second challenge, a pre-trained diffusion model is adopted to generate the historical distribution. During the generation process, the common features between the historical and current distributions are enhanced under the guidance of the TKGR model.

This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative models for this task, MDETR and GLIP.

To empower agents to autonomously explore environments, optimize workflows, and enhance their understanding of actions, we propose SynWorld, a framework that allows agents to synthesize possible scenarios with multi-step action invocation within the action space and perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to effectively refine their action knowledge in the current environment. Our experiments demonstrate that SynWorld is an effective and general approach to learning action knowledge in new environments.

An Empirical Study of Many-to-Many Summarization with Large Language Models,"['Jiaan Wang', 'Fandong Meng', 'Zengkui Sun', 'Yunlong Liang', 'Yuxuan Cao', 'Jiarong Xu', 'HAOXIANG SHI', 'Jie Zhou']","Many-to-many summarization (M2MS) aims to process documents in any language and generate the corresponding summaries also in any language. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong multi-lingual abilities, giving them the potential to perform M2MS in real applications. This work presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs' M2MS ability. Specifically, we first reorganize M2MS data based on eight previous domain-specific datasets. The reorganized data contains 47.8K samples spanning five domains and six languages, which could be used to train and evaluate LLMs. Then, we benchmark 18 LLMs in a zero-shot manner and an instruction-tuning manner. Fine-tuned traditional models (e.g., mBART) are also conducted for comparisons. Our experiments reveal that, zero-shot LLMs achieve competitive results with fine-tuned traditional models. After instruct-tuning, open-source LLMs can significantly improve their M2MS ability, and outperform zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4) in terms of automatic evaluations. In addition, we demonstrate that this task-specific improvement does not sacrifice the LLMs' general task-solving abilities. However, as revealed by our human evaluation, LLMs still face the factuality issue, and the instruction tuning might intensify the issue. Thus, how to control factual errors becomes the key when building LLM summarizers in real applications, and is worth noting in future research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12983v1

Previous studies have made notable progress in benchmarking the instruction following capabilities of LLMs in general domains, with a primary focus on their inherent commonsense knowledge. Recently, LLMs have been increasingly deployed as domain-oriented agents, which rely on domain-oriented guidelines that may conflict with their commonsense knowledge. These guidelines exhibit two key characteristics: they consist of a wide range of domain-oriented rules and are subject to frequent updates. Despite these challenges, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the domain-oriented guideline following capabilities of LLMs presents a significant obstacle to their effective assessment and further development. In this paper, we introduce GuideBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate guideline following performance of LLMs. GuideBench evaluates LLMs on three critical aspects: (i) adherence to diverse rules, (ii) robustness to rule updates, and (iii) alignment with human preferences. Experimental results on a range of LLMs indicate substantial opportunities for improving their ability to follow domain-oriented guidelines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11368v2

Existing training approaches for issue resolving struggle with poor generalization and fail to fully leverage open-source development resources. We propose Subtask-oriented Reinforced Fine-Tuning (SoRFT), a novel training approach to enhance the issue resolving capability of LLMs. We decomposes issue resolving into structured subtasks: file localization, function localization, line localization, and code edit generation. SoRFT consists of two training stages: (1) rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning, Chain of Thought (CoT) data is filtered using ground-truth before fine-tuning the LLM, and (2) rule-based reinforcement learning, which leverages PPO with ground-truth based rewards. We evaluate the SoRFT-trained model on SWE-Bench Verified and SWE-Bench Lite, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models (e.g., resolve 21.4% issues on SWE-Bench Verified with SoRFT-Qwen-7B).

MiniLongBench: The Low-cost Long Context Understanding Benchmark for Large Language Models,"['Zhongzhan Huang', 'Guoming Ling', 'Shanshan Zhong', 'Hefeng Wu', 'Liang Lin']","Long Context Understanding (LCU) is a critical area for exploration in current large language models (LLMs). However, due to the inherently lengthy nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses. Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237 test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore, our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See https://github.com/MilkThink-Lab/MiniLongBench for our code, data and tutorial.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19959v1

To improve the robustness of such systems against noisy retrievals, Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) has emerged as a widely adopted method. However, RAFT conditions models to generate answers even in the absence of reliable knowledge. This behavior undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, where acknowledging uncertainty is critical. To address this issue, we propose Divide-Then-Align (DTA), a post-training approach designed to endow RAG systems with the ability to respond with ""I don't know"" when the query is out of the knowledge boundary of both the retrieved passages and the model's internal knowledge. DTA divides data samples into four knowledge quadrants and constructs tailored preference data for each quadrant, resulting in a curated dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Unifying Continuous and Discrete Text Diffusion with Non-simultaneous Diffusion Processes,"['Bocheng Li', 'Zhujin Gao', 'Linli Xu']","Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation, with recent works falling into two main categories: discrete and continuous diffusion models. Discrete diffusion models apply token corruption independently using categorical distributions, allowing for different diffusion progress across tokens but lacking fine-grained control. Continuous diffusion models map tokens to continuous spaces and apply fine-grained noise, but the diffusion progress is uniform across tokens, limiting their ability to capture semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\underline{N}}on-simultan\textbf{\underline{e}}ous C\textbf{\underline{o}}ntinuous \textbf{\underline{Diff}}usion Models (NeoDiff), a novel diffusion model that integrates the strengths of both discrete and continuous approaches. NeoDiff introduces a Poisson diffusion process for the forward process, enabling a flexible and fine-grained noising paradigm, and employs a time predictor for the reverse process to adaptively modulate the denoising progress based on token semantics. Furthermore, NeoDiff utilizes an optimized schedule for inference to ensure more precise noise control and improved performance. Our approach unifies the theories of discrete and continuous diffusion models, offering a more principled and effective framework for text generation. Experimental results on several text generation tasks demonstrate NeoDiff's superior performance compared to baselines of non-autoregressive continuous and discrete diffusion models, iterative-based methods and autoregressive diffusion-based methods. These results highlight NeoDiff's potential as a powerful tool for generating high-quality text and advancing the field of diffusion-based text generation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22165v1

SPHERE systematically probes models across increasing levels of complexity, from fundamental skills to multi-skill integration and high-level reasoning that combines spatial, visual, and logical understanding. Benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant deficiencies, especially in reasoning about distance and proximity, understanding both egocentric and allocentric perspectives, and applying spatial logic in physical contexts. These findings expose critical blind spots in existing models and underscore the need for more advanced spatial reasoning techniques, driving the development of vision-language models that align more closely with human spatial cognition.

Enhancing Retrieval Systems with Inference-Time Logical Reasoning,"['Felix Faltings', 'Wei Wei', 'Yujia Bao']","Traditional retrieval methods rely on transforming user queries into vector representations and retrieving documents based on cosine similarity within an embedding space. While efficient and scalable, this approach often fails to handle complex queries involving logical constructs such as negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time logical reasoning framework that explicitly incorporates logical reasoning into the retrieval process. Our method extracts logical reasoning structures from natural language queries and then composes the individual cosine similarity scores to formulate the final document scores. This approach enables the retrieval process to handle complex logical reasoning without compromising computational efficiency. Our results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional retrieval methods across different models and datasets, significantly improving retrieval performance for complex queries.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17860v1

Examining jailbreak prompts helps uncover the shortcomings of LLMs. However, current jailbreak methods and the target model's defenses are engaged in an independent and adversarial process, resulting in the need for frequent attack iterations and redesigning attacks for different models. To address these gaps, we propose a Reverse Embedded Defense Attack (REDA) mechanism that disguises the attack intention as the ""defense"". intention against harmful content. Specifically, REDA starts from the target response, guiding the model to embed harmful content within its defensive measures, thereby relegating harmful content to a secondary role and making the model believe it is performing a defensive task. The attacking model considers that it is guiding the target model to deal with harmful content, while the target model thinks it is performing a defensive task, creating an illusion of cooperation between the two. Additionally, to enhance the model's confidence and guidance in ""defensive"" intentions, we adopt in-context learning (ICL) with a small number of attack examples and construct a corresponding dataset of attack examples. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the REDA method enables cross-model attacks without the need to redesign attack strategies for different models, enables successful jailbreak in one iteration, and outperforms existing methods on both open-source and closed-source models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12621v1

In high-stakes domains, it is crucial to understand where and how the content is created. To address this, we introduce the Text pROVEnance (TROVE) challenge, designed to trace each sentence of a target text back to specific source sentences within potentially lengthy or multi-document inputs. Beyond identifying sources, TROVE annotates the fine-grained relationships (quotation, compression, inference, and others), providing a deep understanding of how each target sentence is formed.

To ensure high-quality data, we employ a three-stage annotation process: sentence retrieval, GPT-4o provenance, and human provenance. We evaluate 11 LLMs under direct prompting and retrieval-augmented paradigms, revealing that retrieval is essential for robust performance, larger models perform better in complex relationship classification, and closed-source models often lead, yet open-source models show significant promise, particularly with retrieval augmentation.

We define culturally specific questions as those that refer to concepts unique to one or a few cultures, or have different answers depending on the cultural or regional context. We obtain these questions by crawling naturally-occurring questions from community web forums in high-resource languages, and by hiring native speakers to write questions in under-resourced, rarely-studied languages such as Fijian and Kirundi. Our data collection methodologies are translation-free, enabling the collection of culturally unique questions like ""Kuber iki umwami wa mbere w'uburundi yitwa Ntare?""

The results reveal that different ranks within the LoRA modules not only exhibit varying levels of importance but also evolve dynamically throughout the fine-tuning process, which may limit the performance of LoRA. Based on these findings, we propose BeamLoRA, which conceptualizes each LoRA module as a beam where each rank naturally corresponds to a potential sub-solution, and the fine-tuning process becomes a search for the optimal sub-solution combination. BeamLoRA dynamically eliminates underperforming sub-solutions while expanding the parameter space for promising ones, enhancing performance with a fixed rank.

Specifically, we design a pipeline that generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data.

In this work, we introduce a quantitative metric, Information Emergence (IE), designed to measure LLMs' ability to extract semantics from input tokens. We formalize ``semantics'' as the meaningful information abstracted from a sequence of tokens and quantify this by comparing the entropy reduction observed for a sequence of tokens (macro-level) and individual tokens (micro-level). To achieve this, we design a lightweight estimator to compute the mutual information at each transformer layer, which is agnostic to different tasks and language model architectures. We apply IE in both synthetic in-context learning (ICL) scenarios and natural sentence contexts. Experiments demonstrate informativeness and patterns about semantics.

The Tug of War Within: Mitigating the Fairness-Privacy Conflicts in Large Language Models,"['Chen Qian', 'Dongrui Liu', 'Jie Zhang', 'Yong Liu', 'Jing Shao']","Ensuring awareness of fairness and privacy in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical. Interestingly, we discover a counter-intuitive trade-off phenomenon that enhancing an LLM's privacy awareness through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods significantly decreases its fairness awareness with thousands of samples. To address this issue, inspired by the information theory, we introduce a training-free method to \textbf{S}uppress the \textbf{P}rivacy and fa\textbf{I}rness coupled \textbf{N}eurons (\textbf{SPIN}), which theoretically and empirically decrease the mutual information between fairness and privacy awareness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPIN eliminates the trade-off phenomenon and significantly improves LLMs' fairness and privacy awareness simultaneously without compromising general capabilities, \eg improving Qwen-2-7B-Instruct's fairness awareness by 12.2\% and privacy awareness by 14.0\%. More crucially, SPIN remains robust and effective with limited annotated data or even when only malicious fine-tuning data is available, whereas SFT methods may fail to perform properly in such scenarios. Furthermore, we show that SPIN could generalize to other potential trade-off dimensions. We hope this study provides valuable insights into concurrently addressing fairness and privacy concerns in LLMs and can be integrated into comprehensive frameworks to develop more ethical and responsible AI systems.

GraphInsight: Unlocking Insights in Large Language Models for Graph Structure Understanding,"['Yukun Cao', 'Shuo Han', 'Zengyi Gao', 'Zezhong Ding', 'Xike Xie', 'S Kevin Zhou']","Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in processing graphs, they struggle with comprehending graphical structure information through prompts of graph description sequences, especially as the graph size increases. We attribute this challenge to the uneven memory performance of LLMs across different positions in graph description sequences, known as ''positional biases''. To address this, we propose GraphInsight, a novel framework aimed at improving LLMs' comprehension of both macro- and micro-level graphical information. GraphInsight is grounded in two key strategies: 1) placing critical graphical information in positions where LLMs exhibit stronger memory performance, and 2) investigating a lightweight external knowledge base for regions with weaker memory performance, inspired by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Moreover, GraphInsight explores integrating these two strategies into LLM agent processes for composite graph tasks that require multi-step reasoning. Extensive empirical studies on benchmarks with a wide range of evaluation tasks show that GraphInsight significantly outperforms all other graph description methods (e.g., prompting techniques and reordering strategies) in understanding graph structures of varying sizes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03258v3

However, to mitigate hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the idea that ""the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to provide a proof"". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose $FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$ formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04592v1
SAM Decoding: Speculative Decoding via Suffix Automaton,"['Yuxuan Hu', 'Ke Wang', 'Xiaokang Zhang', 'Fanjin Zhang', 'Cuiping Li', 'Hong Chen', 'Jing Zhang']","Speculative decoding (SD) has been demonstrated as an effective technique for lossless LLM inference acceleration. Retrieval-based SD methods, one kind of model-free method, have yielded promising speedup, but they often rely on incomplete retrieval resources, inefficient retrieval methods, and are constrained to certain domains. This paper presents a novel retrieval-based speculative decoding method that adapts suffix automaton (SAM) for efficient and accurate draft generation by utilizing common text corpus and dynamic text sequence. Unlike existing $n$-gram matching methods, SAM-Decoding finds the exact longest suffix match, achieving an average time complexity of O(1) per generation step of SAM update and suffix retrieval. It can also integrate with existing methods, adaptively selecting a draft generation strategy based on match length to generalize to broader domains. Extensive experiments on Spec-Bench show that our method is $18\%+$ faster than other retrieval-based SD methods. Additionally, when combined with advanced EAGLE-2, it provides an additional speedup of $3.28\%$ -- $11.13\%$ across various-sized LLM backbones.

To address these limitations, this paper leverages preference alignment techniques, which enable targeted construction of out-of-pretraining-distribution data to enhance performance. We introduce a new dataset, named the Intelligibility Preference Speech Dataset (INTP), and extend the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework to accommodate diverse TTS architectures. After INTP alignment, in addition to intelligibility, we observe overall improvements including naturalness, similarity, and audio quality for multiple TTS models across diverse domains. Based on that, we also verify the weak-to-strong generalization ability of INTP for more intelligible models such as CosyVoice 2 and Ints. Moreover, we showcase the potential for further improvements through iterative alignment based on Ints. Audio samples are available at https://intalign.github.io/.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04113v2
GiFT: Gibbs Fine-Tuning for Code Generation,"['Haochen Li', 'Wanjin Feng', 'Xin Zhou', 'Zhiqi Shen']","Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with synthetic data is a prevalent practice in code generation. A key approach is self-training, where LLMs are iteratively trained on self-generated correct code snippets. In this case, the self-generated codes are drawn from a conditional distribution, conditioned on a specific seed description. However, the seed description is not the only valid representation that aligns with its intended meaning. With all valid descriptions and codes forming a joint space, codes drawn from the conditional distribution would lead to an underrepresentation of the full description-code space. As such, we propose Gibbs Fine-Tuning (GiFT), a novel self-training method inspired by Gibbs sampling. GiFT allows self-generated data to be drawn from the marginal distribution of the joint space, thereby mitigating the biases inherent in conditional sampling. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the potential benefits of fine-tuning LLMs with code derived from the marginal distribution. Furthermore, we propose a perplexity-based code selection method to mitigate the imbalanced long-tail distribution of the self-generated codes. Empirical evaluation of two LLMs across four datasets demonstrates that GiFT achieves superior performance, particularly on more challenging benchmarks.

Enhancing Interpretable Image Classification Through LLM Agents and Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models,"['Yiwen Jiang', 'Deval Mehta', 'Wei Feng', 'Zongyuan Ge']","Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) decompose image classification into a process governed by interpretable, human-readable concepts. Recent advances in CBMs have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate concepts. However, a critical question remains: What is the optimal number of concepts to use? Current concept banks suffer from redundancy or insufficient coverage. To address this issue, we introduce a dynamic, agent-based approach that adjusts the concept bank in response to environmental feedback, optimizing the number of concepts for sufficiency yet concise coverage. Moreover, we propose Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models (CoCoBMs) to overcome the limitations in traditional CBMs' concept scoring mechanisms. It enhances the accuracy of assessing each concept's contribution to classification tasks and feature an editable matrix that allows LLMs to correct concept scores that conflict with their internal knowledge.

Reliably Bounding False Positives: A Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal Prediction,"['Xiaowei Zhu', 'Yubing Ren', 'Yanan Cao', 'Xixun Lin', 'Fang Fang', 'Yangxi Li']","The rapid advancement of large language models has raised significant concerns regarding their potential misuse by malicious actors. As a result, developing effective detectors to mitigate these risks has become a critical priority. However, most existing detection methods focus excessively on detection accuracy, often neglecting the societal risks posed by high false positive rates (FPRs). This paper addresses this issue by leveraging Conformal Prediction (CP), which effectively constrains the upper bound of FPRs. While directly applying CP constrains FPRs, it also leads to a significant reduction in detection performance. To overcome this trade-off, this paper proposes a Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal Prediction (MCP), which both enforces the FPR constraint and improves detection performance. This paper also introduces RealDet, a high-quality dataset that spans a wide range of domains, ensuring realistic calibration and enabling superior detection performance when combined with MCP. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MCP effectively constrains FPRs, significantly enhances detection performance, and increases robustness against adversarial attacks across multiple detectors and datasets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05084v2
RSCF: Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter for Entity Embedding of Knowledge Graph,"['Junsik Kim', 'Jinwook Park', 'Kangil Kim']","In knowledge graph embedding, leveraging relation specific entity transformation has markedly enhanced performance. However, the consistency of embedding differences before and after transformation remains unaddressed, risking the loss of valuable inductive bias inherent in the embeddings. This inconsistency stems from two problems. First, transformation representations are specified for relations in a disconnected manner, allowing dissimilar transformations and corresponding entity embeddings for similar relations. Second, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter Based on Relations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration of entity embeddings under entity-based regularization, generating indistinguishable score distributions among relations. In this paper, we introduce a plug-in KGE method, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF). Its entity transformation has three features for enhancing semantic consistency: 1) shared affine transformation of relation embeddings across all relations, 2) rooted entity transformation that adds an entity embedding to its change represented by the transformed vector, and 3) normalization of the change to prevent scale reduction. To amplify the advantages of consistency that preserve semantics on embeddings, RSCF adds relation transformation and prediction modules for enhancing the semantics. In knowledge graph completion tasks with distance-based and tensor decomposition models, RSCF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods, showing robustness across all relations and their frequencies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20813v3

We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model, which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching. Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL, highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has proven effective in aligning LLM behavior with human preferences across various agent tasks. However, standard DPO focuses solely on individual turns, which limits its effectiveness in multi-turn social interactions. Several DPO-based multi-turn alignment methods with session-level data have shown potential in addressing this problem.While these methods consider multiple turns across entire sessions, they are often overly coarse-grained, introducing training noise, and lack robust theoretical support. To resolve these limitations, we propose Segment-Level Direct Preference Optimization (SDPO), which dynamically select key segments within interactions to optimize multi-turn agent behavior. SDPO minimizes training noise and is grounded in a rigorous theoretical framework. Evaluations on the SOTOPIA benchmark demonstrate that SDPO-tuned agents consistently outperform both existing DPO-based methods and proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o, underscoring SDPO's potential to advance the social intelligence of LLM-based agents.

Using this method, we construct KokoroChat, a Japanese psychological counseling dialogue dataset comprising 6,589 long-form dialogues, each accompanied by comprehensive client feedback.

Therefore, we introduce WavRAG, the first retrieval augmented generation framework with native, end-to-end audio support. WavRAG offers two key features: 1) Bypassing ASR, WavRAG directly processes raw audio for both embedding and retrieval. 2) WavRAG integrates audio and text into a unified knowledge representation.

Finding the Sweet Spot: Preference Data Construction for Scaling Preference Optimization,"['Yao Xiao', 'Hai Ye', 'Linyao Chen', 'Hwee Tou Ng', 'Lidong Bing', 'Xiaoli Li', 'Roy Ka-Wei Lee']","Iterative data generation and model retraining are widely used to align large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a policy model to generate on-policy responses and a reward model to guide training data selection. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) further enhances this process by constructing preference pairs of chosen and rejected responses. In this work, we aim to \emph{scale up} the number of on-policy samples via repeated random sampling to improve alignment performance. Conventional practice selects the sample with the highest reward as chosen and the lowest as rejected for DPO. However, our experiments reveal that this strategy leads to a \emph{decline} in performance as the sample size increases. To address this, we investigate preference data construction through the lens of underlying normal distribution of sample rewards. We categorize the reward space into seven representative points and systematically explore all 21 ($C_7^2$) pairwise combinations.

Existing methods are based on the assumption that different nodes exhibit varying degrees of influence on predictions. They define nodes with high predictive influence as important nodes and target them for attacks. If the model treats nodes' predictive influence more uniformly, attackers will find it harder to target high predictive influence nodes. In this paper, we propose Similarizing the predictive Influence of Nodes with Contrastive Learning (SINCon), a defense mechanism that encourages the model to learn graph representations where nodes with varying importance have a more uniform influence on predictions.

Outlier-Safe Pre-Training for Robust 4-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models,"['Jungwoo Park', 'Chanwoong Yoon', 'Hyeon Hwang', 'Taewhoo Lee', 'Jaewoo Kang']","Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment. While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection, redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive 4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10 benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2% training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis (0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way for more efficient LLM deployment.

Planning-Driven Programming: A Large Language Model Programming Workflow,"['Chao Lei', 'Yanchuan Chang', 'Nir Lipovetzky', 'Krista A.

Recent research suggests continuous program refinements through visible tests to improve code generation accuracy in LLMs. However, these methods suffer from LLMs' inefficiency and limited reasoning capacity. In this work, we propose an LLM programming workflow (LPW) designed to improve both initial code generation and subsequent refinements within a structured two-phase workflow. Specifically, the solution generation phase formulates a solution plan, which is then verified through visible tests to specify the intended natural language solution. Subsequently, the code implementation phase drafts an initial code according to the solution plan and its verification. If the generated code fails the visible tests, the plan verification serves as the intended solution to consistently inform the refinement process for correcting bugs.

Can Knowledge Graphs Make Large Language Models More Trustworthy? An Empirical Study Over Open-ended Question Answering,"['Yuan Sui', 'Yufei He', 'Zifeng Ding', 'Bryan Hooi']","Recent works integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have shown promising improvements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on closed-ended tasks, leaving a gap in evaluating performance on more complex, real-world scenarios. This limitation also hinders a thorough assessment of KGs' potential to reduce hallucinations in LLMs. To address this, we introduce OKGQA, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs augmented with KGs in open-ended, real-world question answering settings. OKGQA reflects practical complexities through diverse question types and incorporates metrics to quantify both hallucination rates and reasoning improvements in LLM+KG models. To consider the scenarios in which KGs may contain varying levels of errors, we propose a benchmark variant, OKGQA-P, to assess model performance when the semantics and structure of KGs are deliberately perturbed and contaminated. In this paper, we aims to (1) explore whether KGs can make LLMs more trustworthy in an open-ended setting, and (2) conduct a comparative analysis to shed light on method design. We believe this study can facilitate a more complete performance comparison and encourages continuous improvement in integrating KGs with LLMs to mitigate hallucination, and make LLMs more trustworthy.

Nudging: Inference-time Alignment of LLMs via Guided Decoding,"['Yu Fei', 'Yasaman Razeghi', 'Sameer Singh']","Large language models (LLMs) require alignment to effectively and safely follow user instructions. This process necessitates training an aligned version for every base model, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose NUDGING, a simple, training-free algorithm that aligns any base model at inference time using a small aligned model. NUDGING is motivated by recent findings that alignment primarily alters the model's behavior on a small subset of stylistic tokens (e.g., discourse markers). We find that base models are significantly more uncertain when generating these tokens. Building on this insight, NUDGING employs a small aligned model to generate nudging tokens to guide the base model's output during decoding when the base model's uncertainty is high, with only a minor additional inference overhead. We evaluate NUDGING across 3 model families on a diverse range of open-instruction tasks. Without any training, nudging a large base model with a 7x-14x smaller aligned model achieves zero-shot performance comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, that of large aligned models. By operating at the token level, NUDGING enables off-the-shelf collaboration between model families. For instance, nudging Gemma-2-27b with Llama-27b-chat outperforms Llama-2-70b-chat on various tasks. Overall, our work offers a modular and cost-efficient solution to LLM alignment.

Unveiling Attractor Cycles in Large Language Models: A Dynamical Systems View of Successive Paraphrasing,"['Zhilin Wang', 'Yafu Li', 'Jianhao Yan', 'Yu Cheng', 'Yue Zhang']","Dynamical systems theory provides a framework for analyzing iterative processes and evolution over time. Within such systems, repetitive transformations can lead to stable configurations, known as attractors, including fixed points and limit cycles. Applying this perspective to large language models (LLMs), which iteratively map input text to output text, provides a principled approach to characterizing long-term behaviors. Successive paraphrasing serves as a compelling testbed for exploring such dynamics, as paraphrases re-express the same underlying meaning with linguistic variation. Although LLMs are expected to explore a diverse set of paraphrases in the text space, our study reveals that successive paraphrasing converges to stable periodic states, such as 2-period attractor cycles, limiting linguistic diversity. This phenomenon is attributed to the self-reinforcing nature of LLMs, as they iteratively favour and amplify certain textual forms over others. This pattern persists with increasing generation randomness or alternating prompts and LLMs. These findings underscore inherent constraints in LLM generative capability, while offering a novel dynamical systems perspective for studying their expressive potential.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15208v2
State-offset Tuning: State-based Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for State Space Models,"['Wonjun Kang', 'Kevin Galim', 'Yuchen Zeng', 'Minjae Lee', 'Hyung Il Koo', 'Nam Ik Cho']","State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers, mitigating their quadratic computational cost. However, the application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods to SSMs remains largely unexplored. In particular, prompt-based methods like Prompt Tuning and Prefix-Tuning, which are widely used in Transformers, do not perform well on SSMs. To address this, we propose state-based methods as a superior alternative to prompt-based methods. This new family of methods naturally stems from the architectural characteristics of SSMs. State-based methods adjust state-related features directly instead of depending on external prompts. Furthermore, we introduce a novel state-based PEFT method: State-offset Tuning. At every timestep, our method directly affects the state at the current step, leading to more effective adaptation. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

SCAR: Data Selection via Style Consistency-Aware Response Ranking for Efficient Instruction-Tuning of Large Language Models,"['Zhuang Li', 'YUNCHENG HUA', 'Thuy-Trang Vu', 'Haolan Zhan', 'Lizhen Qu', 'Gholamreza Haffari']","Recent studies emphasize that manually ensuring a consistent response style and maintaining high data quality in training sets can significantly improve the performance of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) while reducing the number of training examples needed. However, the precise definition of style and the relationship between style, data quality, and LLM performance remains unclear. This research identifies two key stylistic elements in responses: linguistic form and instructional surprisal. We find that, among training data of comparable quality, higher consistency in these response elements leads to better LLM performance. Inspired by this, we introduce Style Consistency-Aware Response Ranking (SCAR), which automatically prioritizes instruction-response pairs in the training set based on their response stylistic consistency. By selecting the most style-consistent examples, using only 0.7% of the full dataset in the best case, the fine-tuned LLMs can match or even surpass the performance of models trained on the entire dataset in coding and open-ended question-answering benchmarks.

Internal and External Impacts of Natural Language Processing Papers,['Yu Zhang'],"We investigate the impacts of NLP research published in top-tier conferences (i.e., ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL) from 1979 to 2024. By analyzing citations from research articles and external sources such as patents, media, and policy documents, we examine how different NLP topics are consumed both within the academic community and by the broader public. Our findings reveal that language modeling has the widest internal and external influence, while linguistic foundations have lower impacts. We also observe that internal and external impacts generally align, but topics like ethics, bias, and fairness show significant attention in policy documents with much fewer academic citations. Additionally, external domains exhibit distinct preferences, with patents focusing on practical NLP applications and media and policy documents engaging more with the societal implications of NLP models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16061v1
HFT: Half Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models,"['Tingfeng Hui', 'Zhenyu Zhang', 'Shuohuan Wang', 'Weiran Xu', 'Yu Sun', 'Hua Wu']","Large language models (LLMs) with one or more fine-tuning phases have become a necessary step to unlock various capabilities, enabling LLMs to follow natural language instructions or align with human preferences. However, it carries the risk of catastrophic forgetting during sequential training, the parametric knowledge or the ability learned in previous stages may be overwhelmed by incoming training data. In this paper, we find that by regularly resetting partial parameters, LLMs can restore some of the original knowledge. Inspired by this, we introduce Half Fine-Tuning (HFT) for LLMs, as a substitute for full fine-tuning (FFT), to mitigate the forgetting issues, where half of the parameters are selected to learn new tasks while the other half are frozen to remain previous knowledge. We provide a feasibility analysis from the perspective of optimization and interpret the parameter selection operation as a regularization term. Without changing the model architecture, HFT could be seamlessly integrated into existing fine-tuning frameworks. Extensive experiments and analysis on supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and continual learning consistently demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of HFT. Compared with FFT, HFT not only significantly alleviates the forgetting problem, but also achieves the best performance in a series of downstream benchmarks, with an approximately 30% reduction in training time.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18466v1

Traditional generation methods focus primarily on textual quality, but they often overlook educational objectives. Moreover, these methods address only single-dimensional, simple question generation, failing to meet complex, multifaceted educational requirements. To address these challenges, we constructed and annotated EduMath, a dataset of 16k mathematical questions with multi-dimensional educational objectives. Based on this dataset, we developed EQGEVAL, which incorporates three evaluation dimensions and is designed to assess the ability of models to generate educational questions. Drawing inspiration from teachers' problem design processes, we propose the Educational Question Planning with self-Reflection (EQPR) method for educational mathematical question generation, following a ""plan-evaluate-optimize"" approach. Specifically, by combining planning algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models, we continuously optimize questions through iterative feedback. This self-optimization mechanism ensures that the generated questions both fit the educational context and strategically achieve specific basic educational objectives. Through extensive experiments based on EQGEVAL, we have demonstrated that EQPR achieves significant improvements in generating questions that meet multi-dimensional educational objectives.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00963v1
RankCoT: Refining Knowledge for Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Ranking Chain-of-Thoughts,"['Mingyan Wu', 'Zhenghao Liu', 'Yukun Yan', 'Xinze Li', 'Shi Yu', 'Zheni Zeng', 'Yu Gu', 'Ge Yu']","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. However, LLMs still encounter challenges in effectively utilizing the knowledge from retrieved documents, often being misled by irrelevant or noisy information. To address this issue, we introduce RankCoT, a knowledge refinement method that incorporates reranking signals in generating CoT-based summarization for knowledge refinement based on given query and all retrieval documents. During training, RankCoT prompts the LLM to generate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) candidates based on the query and individual documents. It then fine-tunes the LLM to directly reproduce the best CoT from these candidate outputs based on all retrieved documents, which requires LLM to filter out irrelevant documents during generating CoT-style summarization. Additionally, RankCoT incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that further refines the CoT outputs, resulting in higher-quality training data. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RankCoT, showing its superior performance over other knowledge refinement models. Further analysis reveals that RankCoT can provide shorter but effective refinement results, enabling the generator to produce more accurate answers.

Lost in Literalism: How Supervised Training Shapes Translationese in LLMs,"['Yafu Li', 'Ronghao Zhang', 'Zhilin Wang', 'Huajian Zhang', 'Leyang Cui', 'Yongjing Yin', 'Tong Xiao', 'Yue Zhang']","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in machine translation, demonstrating impressive performance across diverse languages. However, translationese, characterized by overly literal and unnatural translations, remains a persistent challenge in LLM-based translation systems. Despite their pre-training on vast corpora of natural utterances, LLMs exhibit translationese errors and generate unexpected unnatural translations, stemming from biases introduced during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we systematically evaluate the prevalence of translationese in LLM-generated translations and investigate its roots during supervised training. We introduce methods to mitigate these biases, including polishing golden references and filtering unnatural training instances. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that these approaches significantly reduce translationese while improving translation naturalness, validated by human evaluations and automatic metrics. Our findings highlight the need for training-aware adjustments to optimize LLM translation outputs, paving the way for more fluent and target-language-consistent translations.

An Effective Incorporating Heterogeneous Knowledge Curriculum Learning for Sequence Labeling,"['Xuemei Tang', 'Jun Wang', 'Qi Su', 'Chu-Ren Huang', 'Jinghang Gu']","Sequence labeling models often benefit from incorporating external knowledge. However, this practice introduces data heterogeneity and complicates the model with additional modules, leading to increased expenses for training a high-performing model. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning (TCL) framework specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks. The TCL framework enhances training by gradually introducing data instances from easy to hard, aiming to improve both performance and training speed. Furthermore, we explore different metrics for assessing the difficulty levels of sequence labeling tasks. Through extensive experimentation on six Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and Part-of-speech tagging (POS) datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in enhancing the performance of sequence labeling models. Additionally, our analysis indicates that TCL accelerates training and alleviates the slow training problem associated with complex models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13534v2
Accurate KV Cache Quantization with Outlier Tokens Tracing,"['Yi Su', 'Yuechi Zhou', 'Quantong Qiu', 'Juntao Li', 'Qingrong Xia', 'Ping Li', 'Xinyu Duan', 'Zhefeng Wang', 'Min Zhang']","The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) come at the cost of substantial computational resources during deployment. While KV Cache can significantly reduce recomputation during inference, it also introduces additional memory overhead. KV Cache quantization presents a promising solution, striking a good balance between memory usage and accuracy. Previous research has shown that the Keys are distributed by channel, while the Values are distributed by token. Consequently, the common practice is to apply channel-wise quantization to the Keys and token-wise quantization to the Values. However, our further investigation reveals that a small subset of unusual tokens exhibit unique characteristics that deviate from this pattern, which can substantially impact quantization accuracy. To address this, we develop a simple yet effective method to identify these tokens accurately during the decoding process and exclude them from quantization as outlier tokens, significantly improving overall accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves significant accuracy improvements under 2-bit quantization and can deliver a 6.4 times reduction in memory usage and a 2.3 times increase in throughput.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10938v1

In this paper, we propose Upcycling Instruction Tuning (UpIT), a data-efficient approach for tuning a dense pre-trained model into a MoE instruction model. Specifically, we first point out that intermediate checkpoints during instruction tuning of the dense model are naturally suitable for specialized experts, and then propose an expert expansion stage to flexibly achieve models with flexible numbers of experts, where genetic algorithm and parameter merging are introduced to ensure sufficient diversity of new extended experts. To ensure that each specialized expert in the MoE model works as expected, we select a small amount of seed data that each expert excels to pre-optimize the router. Extensive experiments with various data scales and upcycling settings demonstrate the outstanding performance and data efficiency of UpIT, as well as stable improvement in expert or data scaling.

Current research suggests that multi-task training outperforms single-task as different tasks can benefit each other, but they often overlook the internal relationships within these tasks. To analyze this phenomenon, we attempted to employ compositional generalization (CG), which refers to the models' ability to understand novel combinations by recombining learned elements, as a guiding framework. Since medical images can be precisely defined by Modality, Anatomical area, and Task, naturally providing an environment for exploring CG, we assembled 106 medical datasets to create Med-MAT for comprehensive experiments. The experiments confirmed that MLLMs can use CG to understand unseen medical images and identified CG as one of the main drivers of the generalization observed in multi-task training.

The results highlight three key findings on how to construct a reliable benchmark: (i) it is important to minimize differences between chosen and rejected responses beyond correctness, (ii) evaluating reward models requires multiple comparisons across a wide range of chosen and rejected responses, and (iii) given that reward models encounter responses with diverse representations, responses should be sourced from a variety of models. However, we also observe that a extremely high correlation with degree of overoptimization leads to comparatively lower correlation with certain downstream performance.

However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1 outperforms prior task-specific discriminative and generative SE models, demonstrating scaling effects at test time and emerging capabilities for unseen SE tasks. Additionally, we release our code and models to support further research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00493v4
MadaKV: Adaptive Modality-Perception KV Cache Eviction for Efficient Multimodal Long-Context Inference,"['Kunxi Li', 'Zhonghua Jiang', 'Zhouzhou Shen', 'ZhaodeWang', 'chengfei lv', 'Shengyu Zhang', 'Fan Wu', 'Fei Wu']","This paper introduces MadaKV, a modality-adaptive key-value (KV) cache eviction strategy designed to enhance the efficiency of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in long-context inference. In multimodal scenarios, attention heads exhibit varying preferences for different modalities, resulting in significant disparities in modality importance across attention heads. Traditional KV cache eviction methods, which are tailored for unimodal settings, fail to capture modality-specific information, thereby yielding suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through two key components: modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial reductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency (1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various multimodal long-context tasks. Extensive experiments on representative MLLMs and the MileBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MadaKV compared to existing KV cache eviction methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15724v1
Efficient OpAmp Adaptation for Zoom Attention to Golden Contexts,"['Haoyuan Wu', 'Rui Ming', 'Haisheng Zheng', 'Zhuolun He', 'Bei Yu']","Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in question-answering (QA) tasks, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios and long-context applications. However, their performance is hindered by noisy reference documents, which often distract from essential information. Despite fine-tuning efforts, Transformer-based architectures struggle to prioritize relevant content. This is evidenced by their tendency to allocate disproportionate attention to irrelevant or later-positioned documents. Recent work proposes the differential attention mechanism to address this issue, but this mechanism is limited by an unsuitable common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and high computational costs. Inspired by the operational amplifier (OpAmp), we propose the OpAmp adaptation to address these challenges, which is implemented with adapters efficiently. By integrating the adapter into pre-trained Transformer blocks, our approach enhances focus on the golden context without costly training from scratch. Empirical evaluations on noisy-context benchmarks reveal that our Qwen2.5-OpAmp-72B model, trained with our OpAmp adaptation, surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12502v1

While existing research expands LLMs access to diverse tools (e.g., program interpreters, search engines, calculators), the necessity of using these tools is often overlooked, leading to indiscriminate tool invocation. This naive approach raises two key issues: increased latency due to unnecessary tool calls, and potential errors resulting from faulty interactions with external tools. In this paper, we introduce meta-cognition as a proxy for LLMs self-assessment of their capabilities, reflecting the model's awareness of its own limitations. Based on this, we propose MeCo, an adaptive decision-making strategy for external tool use. MeCo quantifies metacognitive scores by capturing high-level cognitive signals in the representation space, guiding when to invoke tools. Notably, MeCo is fine-tuning-free and incurs minimal cost. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks show that MeCo reliably detects LLMs' internal cognitive signals and significantly improves tool-use decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12961v2

We introduce a simple yet effective framework, CSRT, to synthesize codeswitching red-teaming queries and investigate the safety and multilingual understanding of LLMs comprehensively. Through extensive experiments with ten state-of-the-art LLMs and code-switching queries combining up to 10 languages, we demonstrate that the CSRT significantly outperforms existing multilingual red-teaming techniques, achieving 46.7% more attacks than standard attacks in English and being effective in conventional safety domains. We also examine the multilingual ability of those LLMs to generate and understand codeswitching texts. Additionally, we validate the extensibility of the CSRT by generating codeswitching attack prompts with monolingual data. We finally conduct detailed ablation studies exploring code-switching and propound unintended correlation between resource availability of languages and safety alignment in existing multilingual LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15481v3

To evaluate clinical agents holistically, we propose ClinicalAgent Bench~(CAB), a comprehensive medical agent benchmark consisting of 18 tasks across five key realistic clinical dimensions. Building on this, we introduce ReflecTool, a novel framework that excels at utilizing domain-specific tools within two stages. The first optimization stage progressively enlarges a long-term memory by saving successful solving processes and tool-wise experience of agents in a tiny pre-defined training set. In the following inference stage, ReflecTool can search for supportive successful demonstrations from already built long-term memory to guide the tool selection strategy, and a verifier improves the tool usage according to the tool-wise experience with two verification methods--iterative refinement and candidate selection.

However, it is infeasible to collect all possible instruction datasets simultaneously in real-world scenarios. Thus, enabling MLLM with continual instruction tuning is essential for maintaining their adaptability. However, existing methods often trade off memory efficiency for performance gains, significantly compromising overall efficiency.

To this end, we propose a two-stage framework to learn and apply quantized codes for each entity, aiming for the seamless integration of KGs with LLMs. Firstly, a self-supervised quantized representation (SSQR) method is proposed to compress both KG structural and semantic knowledge into discrete codes (\ie, tokens) that align the format of language sentences. We further design KG instruction-following data by viewing these learned codes as features to directly input to LLMs, thereby achieving seamless integration. The experiment results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms existing unsupervised quantized methods, producing more distinguishable codes. Further, the fine-tuned LLaMA2 and LLaMA3.1 also have superior performance on KG link prediction and triple classification tasks, utilizing only 16 tokens per entity instead of thousands in conventional prompting methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18119v1

(2) Next, we identify the circuit (a subset of model components, responsible for tracking the world state), indicating that late-layer MLP neurons play a key role. We propose two metrics, compression and distinction, and show that the neuron sets for each state achieve nearly 100% accuracy, providing evidence of an implicit finite state automaton (FSA) embedded within the model.

To address this issue, one straightforward solution is to introduce task-specific LoRA modules as domain experts, leveraging the modeling of multiple experts' capabilities and thus enhancing the general capability of multi-task learning. Despite promising, these additional components often add complexity to the training and inference process, contravening the efficient characterization of PEFT designed for. Considering this, we introduce an innovative PEFT method, TeamLoRA, consisting of a collaboration and competition module for experts, and thus achieving the right balance of effectiveness and efficiency: (i) For collaboration, a novel knowledge-sharing and -organizing mechanism is devised to appropriately reduce the scale of matrix operations, thereby boosting the training and inference speed. (ii) For competition, we propose leveraging a game-theoretic interaction mechanism for experts, encouraging experts to transfer their domain-specific knowledge while facing diverse downstream tasks, and thus enhancing the performance. By doing so, TeamLoRA elegantly connects the experts as a ""Team"" with internal collaboration and competition, enabling a faster and more accurate PEFT paradigm for multi-task learning. To validate the superiority of TeamLoRA, we curate a comprehensive multi-task evaluation(CME) benchmark to thoroughly assess the capability of multi-task learning.

CRiskEval: A Chinese Multi-Level Risk Evaluation Benchmark Dataset for Large Language Models,"['Ling Shi', 'Deyi Xiong']","Large language models (LLMs) are possessed of numerous beneficial capabilities, yet their potential inclination harbors unpredictable risks that may materialize in the future. We hence propose CRiskEval, a Chinese dataset meticulously designed for gauging the risk proclivities inherent in LLMs such as resource acquisition and malicious coordination, as part of efforts for proactive preparedness. To curate CRiskEval, we define a new risk taxonomy with 7 types of frontier risks and 4 safety levels, including extremely hazardous,moderately hazardous, neutral and safe. We follow the philosophy of tendency evaluation to empirically measure the stated desire of LLMs via fine-grained multiple-choice question answering. The dataset consists of 14,888 questions that simulate scenarios related to predefined 7 types of frontier risks. Each question is accompanied with 4 answer choices that state opinions or behavioral tendencies corresponding to the question. All answer choices are manually annotated with one of the defined risk levels so that we can easily build a fine-grained frontier risk profile for each assessed LLM. Extensive evaluation with CRiskEval on a spectrum of prevalent Chinese LLMs has unveiled a striking revelation: most models exhibit risk tendencies of more than 40% (weighted tendency to the four risk levels). Furthermore, a subtle increase in the model's inclination toward urgent self-sustainability, power seeking and other dangerous goals becomes evident as the size of models increase. To promote further research on the frontier risk evaluation of LLMs, we publicly release our dataset at https://github.com/lingshi6565/Risk_eval.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04752v1
STUN: Structured-Then-Unstructured Pruning for Scalable MoE Pruning,"['Jaeseong Lee', 'seung-won hwang', 'Aurick Qiao', 'Daniel F Campos', 'Zhewei Yao', 'Yuxiong He']","Mixture-of-experts (MoEs) have been adopted for reducing inference costs by sparsely activating experts in Large language models (LLMs). Despite this reduction, the massive number of experts in MoEs still makes them expensive to serve. In this paper, we study how to address this, by pruning MoEs. Among pruning methodologies, unstructured pruning has been known to achieve the highest performance for a given pruning ratio, compared to structured pruning, since the latter imposes constraints on the sparsification structure. This is intuitive, as the solution space of unstructured pruning subsumes that of structured pruning. However, our counterintuitive finding reveals that expert pruning, a form of structured pruning, can actually precede unstructured pruning to outperform unstructured-only pruning. As existing expert pruning, requiring $O(\frac{k^n}{\sqrt{n}})$ forward passes for $n$ experts, cannot scale for recent MoEs, we propose a scalable alternative with $O(1)$ complexity, yet outperforming the more expensive methods. The key idea is leveraging a latent structure between experts, based on behavior similarity, such that the greedy decision of whether to prune closely captures the joint pruning effect. Ours is highly effective -- for Snowflake Arctic, a 480B-sized MoE with 128 experts, our method needs only one H100 and two hours to achieve nearly no loss in performance with 40% sparsity, even in generative tasks such as GSM8K, where state-of-the-art unstructured pruning fails to.

Mimicking the Familiar: Dynamic Command Generation for Information Theft Attacks in LLM Tool-Learning System,"['Ziyou Jiang', 'Mingyang Li', 'Guowei Yang', 'Junjie Wang', 'Yuekai Huang', 'Zhiyuan Chang', 'Qing Wang']","Information theft attacks pose a significant risk to Large Language Model (LLM) tool-learning systems. Adversaries can inject malicious commands through compromised tools, manipulating LLMs to send sensitive information to these tools, which leads to potential privacy breaches. However, existing attack approaches are black-box oriented and rely on static commands that cannot adapt flexibly to the changes in user queries and the invocation chain of tools. It makes malicious commands more likely to be detected by LLM and leads to attack failure. In this paper, we propose AutoCMD, a dynamic attack comment generation approach for information theft attacks in LLM tool-learning systems. Inspired by the concept of mimicking the familiar, AutoCMD is capable of inferring the information utilized by upstream tools in the toolchain through learning on open-source systems and reinforcement with target system examples, thereby generating more targeted commands for information theft. The evaluation results show that AutoCMD outperforms the baselines with +13.2% $ASR_{Theft}$, and can be generalized to new tool-learning systems to expose their information leakage risks.

To bridge this gap, we present MisBench, the current largest and most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' behavior and knowledge preference toward misinformation. MisBench consists of 10,346,712 pieces of misinformation, which uniquely considers both knowledge-based conflicts and stylistic variations in misinformation. Empirical results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate comparable abilities in discerning misinformation, they still remain susceptible to knowledge conflicts and stylistic variations. Based on these findings, we further propose a novel approach called Reconstruct to Discriminate (RtD) to strengthen LLMs' ability to detect misinformation.

GALLa: Graph Aligned Large Language Models for Improved Source Code Understanding,"['Ziyin Zhang', 'Hang Yu', 'Sage Lee', 'Peng Di', 'Jianguo Li', 'Rui Wang']","Programming languages possess rich semantic information - such as data flow - that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04183v2
MEDDxAgent: A Unified Modular Agent Framework for Explainable Automatic Differential Diagnosis,"['Daniel Philip Rose', 'Chia-Chien Hung', 'Marco Lepri', 'Israa Alqassem', 'Kiril Gashteovski', 'Carolin Lawrence']","Differential Diagnosis (DDx) is a fundamental yet complex aspect of clinical decision-making, in which physicians iteratively refine a ranked list of possible diseases based on symptoms, antecedents, and medical knowledge.

We introduce a Modular Explainable DDx Agent (MEDDxAgent) framework designed for interactive DDx, where diagnostic reasoning evolves through iterative learning, rather than assuming a complete patient profile is accessible. MEDDxAgent integrates three modular components: (1) an orchestrator (DDxDriver), (2) a history taking simulator, and (3) two specialized agents for knowledge retrieval and diagnosis strategy. To ensure robust evaluation, we introduce a comprehensive DDx benchmark covering respiratory, skin, and rare diseases. We analyze single-turn diagnostic approaches and demonstrate the importance of iterative refinement when patient profiles are not available at the outset. Our broad evaluation demonstrates that MEDDxAgent achieves over 10% accuracy improvements in interactive DDx across both large and small LLMs, while offering critical explainability into its diagnostic reasoning process.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19175v2
A Training-free LLM-based Approach to General Chinese Character Error Correction,"['Houquan Zhou', 'Bo Zhang', 'Zhenghua Li', 'Ming Yan', 'Min Zhang']","Chinese spelling correction (CSC) is a crucial task that aims to correct character errors in Chinese text. While conventional CSC focuses on character substitution errors caused by mistyping, two other common types of character errors, missing and redundant characters, have received less attention. These errors are often excluded from CSC datasets during the annotation process or ignored during evaluation, even when they have been annotated. This issue limits the practicality of the CSC task. To address this issue, we introduce the task of General Chinese Character Error Correction (C2EC), which focuses on all three types of character errors. We construct a high-quality C2EC benchmark by combining and manually verifying data from CCTC and Lemon datasets. We extend the training-free prompt-free CSC method to C2EC by using Levenshtein distance for handling length changes and leveraging an additional prompt-based large language model (LLM) to improve performance.

In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1) Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference optimization strategy, which extends beyond traditional adjacent-level optimization by incorporating nuanced implicit preferences, leveraging relative quality in dispreferred data to capture subtle alignment cues for more precise and context-aware optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple medical tasks, including Med-VQA, medical image captioning and instruction following, demonstrate that HSCR not only enhances zero-shot performance but also significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with just 2,000 training entries.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00805v1

Recent Advances in Speech Language Models: A Survey,"['Wenqian Cui', 'Dianzhi Yu', 'Xiaoqi Jiao', 'Ziqiao Meng', 'Guangyan Zhang', 'Qichao Wang', 'Steven Y. Guo', 'Irwin King']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant attention, primarily for their capabilities in text-based interactions. However, natural human interaction often relies on speech, necessitating a shift towards voice-based models. A straightforward approach to achieve this involves a pipeline of ``Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) + LLM + Text-to-Speech (TTS)"", where input speech is transcribed to text, processed by an LLM, and then converted back to speech. Despite being straightforward, this method suffers from inherent limitations, such as information loss during modality conversion, significant latency due to the complex pipeline, and error accumulation across the three stages. To address these issues, Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) -- end-to-end models that generate speech without converting from text -- have emerged as a promising alternative. This survey paper provides the first comprehensive overview of recent methodologies for constructing SpeechLMs, detailing the key components of their architecture and the various training recipes integral to their development.

However, in the multimodal (MM) domain, there is still a lack of a strong MM-Verifier. In this paper, we introduce MM-Verifier and MM-Reasoner to enhance multimodal reasoning through longer inference and more robust verification. First, we propose a two-step MM verification data synthesis method, which combines a simulation-based tree search with verification and uses rejection sampling to generate high-quality Chain-of-Thought (COT) data. This data is then used to fine-tune the verification model, MM-Verifier. Additionally, we present a more efficient method for synthesizing MMCOT data, bridging the gap between text-based and multimodal reasoning. The synthesized data is used to fine-tune MM-Reasoner. Our MM-Verifier outperforms all larger models on the MathCheck, MathVista, and MathVerse benchmarks. Moreover, MM-Reasoner demonstrates strong effectiveness and scalability, with performance improving as data size increases. Finally, our approach achieves strong performance when combining MM-Reasoner and MM-Verifier, reaching an accuracy of 65.3 on MathVista, surpassing GPT-4o (63.8) with 12 rollouts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13383v1

Specifically, a pair of locations may not be lined up in a sequence especially when one location includes the other geographically. In this study, we propose a graph representation that retains information on the geographic hierarchy as well as the temporal order of visited locations, and have constructed a benchmark dataset for graph-structured trajectory extraction. The experiments with our baselines have demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict visited locations and the order among them, but it remains a challenge to predict the hierarchical relations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16633v1

Nevertheless, for broader applications, the robustness of their temporal analysis capability needs to be thoroughly investigated yet predominantly ignored. Motivated by this, we propose a novel temporal robustness benchmark (TemRobBench), which introduces temporal inconsistency perturbations separately at the visual and textual modalities to assess the robustness of models. We evaluate 16 mainstream LMMs and find that they exhibit over-reliance on prior knowledge and textual context in adversarial environments, while ignoring the actual temporal dynamics in the video. To mitigate this issue, we design panoramic direct preference optimization (PanoDPO), which encourages LMMs to incorporate both visual and linguistic feature preferences simultaneously. Experimental results show that PanoDPO can effectively enhance the model's robustness and reliability in temporal analysis.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14405v1

However, current argument relations remain relatively simplistic and foundational, struggling to capture the full scope of argument information, particularly when it comes to representing complex argument structures in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose 14 fine-grained relation types from both vertical and horizontal dimensions, thereby capturing the intricate interplay between argument components for a thorough understanding of argument structure. On this basis, we conducted extensive experiments on three tasks: argument component detection, relation prediction, and automated essay grading. Additionally, we explored the impact of writing quality on argument component detection and relation prediction, as well as the connections between discourse relations and argumentative features. The findings highlight the importance of fine-grained argumentative annotations for argumentative writing quality assessment and encourage multi-dimensional argument analysis.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12028v1

To address this gap, we introduce MaXIFE: a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to assess instruction-following capabilities across 23 different languages with 1667 verifiable instruction tasks. MaXIFE integrates both Rule-Based Evaluation and Model-Based Evaluation, ensuring a balance of efficiency and accuracy.

Linguistic Generalizability of Test-Time Scaling in Mathematical Reasoning,"['Guijin Son', 'Jiwoo Hong', 'Hyunwoo Ko', 'James Thorne']","Scaling pre-training compute has proven effective for achieving mulitlinguality, but does the same hold for test-time scaling? In this work, we introduce MCLM, a multilingual math benchmark featuring competition-level problems in 55 languages. We test three test-time scaling methods-Outcome Reward Modeling (ORM), Process Reward Modeling (ORM), and Budget Forcing (BF)-on both Qwen2.5-1.5B Math and MR1-1.5B, a multilingual LLM we trained for extended reasoning. Our experiments show that using Qwen2.5-1.5B Math with ORM achieves a score of 35.8 on MCLM, while BF on MR1-1.5B attains 35.2. Although ""thinking LLMs"" have recently garnered significant attention, we find that their performance is comparable to traditional scaling methods like best-of-N once constrained to similar levels of inference FLOPs. Moreover, while BF yields a 20-point improvement on English AIME, it provides only a 1.94-point average gain across other languages-a pattern consistent across the other test-time scaling methods we studied-higlighting that test-time scaling may not generalize as effectively to multilingual tasks.

However, there is a lack of work evaluating MLLM for higher-order perception and understanding of Chinese visual content. To fill the gap, we introduce the **C**hinese **I**mage **I**mplication understanding **Bench**mark, **CII-Bench**, which aims to assess the higher-order perception and understanding capabilities of MLLMs for Chinese images. CII-Bench stands out in several ways compared to existing benchmarks. Firstly, to ensure the authenticity of the Chinese context, images in CII-Bench are sourced from the Chinese Internet and manually reviewed, with corresponding answers also manually crafted. Additionally, CII-Bench incorporates images that represent Chinese traditional culture, such as famous Chinese traditional paintings, which can deeply reflect the model's understanding of Chinese traditional culture. Through extensive experiments on CII-Bench across multiple MLLMs, we have made significant findings. Initially, a substantial gap is observed between the performance of MLLMs and humans on CII-Bench. The highest accuracy of MLLMs attains 64.4%, where as human accuracy averages 78.2%, peaking at an impressive 81.0%. Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on Chinese traditional culture images, suggesting limitations in their ability to understand high-level semantics and lack a deep knowledge base of Chinese traditional culture. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit enhanced accuracy when image emotion hints are incorporated into the prompts. We believe that CII-Bench will enable MLLMs to gain a better understanding of Chinese semantics and Chinese-specific images, advancing the journey towards expert artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Fast or Slow? Integrating Fast Intuition and Deliberate Thinking for Enhancing Visual Question Answering,"['Songtao Jiang', 'Chenyi Zhou', 'Yan Zhang', 'Yeying Jin', 'Zuozhu Liu']","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with complex reasoning tasks in Visual Question Answering (VQA). While current methods have advanced by incorporating visual prompts, our study uncovers critical limitations: these approaches indiscriminately annotate all detected objects for every visual question, generating excessive visual markers that degrade task performance. This issue stems primarily from a lack of focus on key visual elements, raising two important questions: Are all objects equally important, and do all questions require visual prompts? Motivated by Dual Process Theory, which distinguishes between instinctive and deliberate cognitive modes in human reasoning, we propose FOCUS, a plug-and-play approach that dynamically adapts to the complexity of questions, combining fast intuitive judgments with deliberate analytical reasoning to enhance the vision-language reasoning capability of the MLLM. For straightforward questions, FOCUS supports efficient zero-shot reasoning. For more complex tasks, it employs the conceptualizing before observation strategy to highlight critical elements. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks, ScienceQA, TextQA, VizWiz, and MME, demonstrate that FOCUS consistently improves the performance of both open-source and black-box MLLMs, achieving significant gains across all datasets. Ablation studies further validate the importance of combining diverse cognitive strategies with refined visual information for superior performance.

Stealing Training Data from Large Language Models in Decentralized Training through Activation Inversion Attack,"['Chenxi Dai', 'Lin Lu', 'Pan Zhou']","Decentralized training has become a resource-efficient framework to democratize the training of large language models (LLMs). However, the privacy risks associated with this framework, particularly due to the potential inclusion of sensitive data in training datasets, remain unexplored. This paper identifies a novel and realistic attack surface: the privacy leakage from training data in decentralized training, and proposes \textit{activation inversion attack} (AIA) for the first time. AIA first constructs a shadow dataset comprising text labels and corresponding activations using public datasets. Leveraging this dataset, an attack model can be trained to reconstruct the training data from activations in victim decentralized training. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLMs and publicly available datasets to demonstrate the susceptibility of decentralized training to AIA. These findings highlight the urgent need to enhance security measures in decentralized training to mitigate privacy risks in training LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16086v1

However, achieving low latency and natural interactions in full-duplex dialogue systems remains a significant challenge, especially considering human conversation dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech. In this paper, we introduce a novel End-to-End GPT-based model OmniFlatten for full-duplex conversation, capable of effectively modeling the complex behaviors inherent to natural conversations with low latency. To achieve full-duplex conversation capabilities, we propose a multi-stage post-training scheme that progressively adapts a text large language model (LLM) backbone into a speech-text dialogue LLM, capable of generating text and speech in real time, without modifying the architecture of the backbone LLM. The training process comprises three stages: modality alignment, half-duplex dialogue learning, and full-duplex dialogue learning. In all training stages, we standardize the data using a flattening operation, which enables unifying the training methods and the GPT backbone across different modalities and tasks. Our approach offers a simple modeling technique and a promising research direction for developing efficient and natural end-to-end full-duplex spoken dialogue systems.

DoMIX: An Efficient Framework for Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Fine-Tuning,"['Dohoon Kim', 'Donghun Kang', 'Taesup Moon']","Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3) providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained models for specific tasks.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting (RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM), seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under zero-shot settings.

"Adapt Once, Thrive with Updates: Transferable Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning on Evolving Base Models","['Naibin Gu', 'Peng Fu', 'Xiyu Liu', 'Ke Ma', 'Zheng Lin', 'Weiping Wang']","Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a common method for fine-tuning large language models, where a base model can serve multiple users through PEFT module switching. To enhance user experience, base models require periodic updates. However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous versions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions. Re-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant computational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur during base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual training primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the Attention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel approach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern while reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model. Further theoretical analysis supports our approach. Extensive experiments across 7 base models and 12 datasets demonstrate that Trans-PEFT trained modules can maintain performance on updated base models without re-tuning, significantly reducing maintenance overhead in real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06844v1

To address this gap, we introduce FERMAT, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of VLMs to detect, localize and correct errors in handwritten mathematical content. FERMAT spans four key error dimensions - computational, conceptual, notational, and presentation - and comprises over 2,200 handwritten math solutions derived from 609 manually curated problems from grades 7-12 with intentionally introduced perturbations. Using FERMAT we benchmark nine VLMs across three tasks: error detection, localization, and correction. Our results reveal significant shortcomings in current VLMs in reasoning over handwritten text, with Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest error correction rate (77%). We also observed that some models struggle with processing handwritten content, as their accuracy improves when handwritten inputs are replaced with printed text or images.

Continual Gradient Low-Rank Projection Fine-Tuning for LLMs,"['Chenxu Wang', 'Yilin Lyu', 'Zicheng Sun', 'Liping Jing']","Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness.

We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Policy changes by Twitter/X and, more recently, Meta, signal a shift away from partnerships with fact-checking organisations and towards an increased reliance on crowdsourced community notes. However, the extent and nature of dependencies between fact-checking and helpful community notes remain unclear. To address these questions, we use language models to annotate a large corpus of Twitter/X community notes with attributes such as topic, cited sources, and whether they refute claims tied to broader misinformation narratives. Our analysis reveals that community notes cite fact-checking sources up to five times more than previously reported. Fact-checking is especially crucial for notes on posts linked to broader narratives, which are twice as likely to reference fact-checking sources compared to other sources. Our results show that successful community moderation relies on professional fact-checking and highlight how citizen and professional fact-checking are deeply intertwined.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14132v2
Towards Robust ESG Analysis Against Greenwashing Risks: Aspect-Action Analysis with Cross-Category Generalization,"['Keane Ong', 'Rui Mao', 'Deeksha varshney', 'Erik Cambria', 'Gianmarco Mengaldo']","Sustainability reports are key for evaluating companies' environmental, social and governance, ESG performance, but their content is increasingly obscured by greenwashing - sustainability claims that are misleading, exaggerated, and fabricated. Yet, existing NLP approaches for ESG analysis lack robustness against greenwashing risks, often extracting insights that reflect misleading or exaggerated sustainability claims rather than objective ESG performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce A3CG - Aspect-Action Analysis with Cross-Category Generalization, as a novel dataset to improve the robustness of ESG analysis amid the prevalence of greenwashing. By explicitly linking sustainability aspects with their associated actions, A3CG facilitates a more fine-grained and transparent evaluation of sustainability claims, ensuring that insights are grounded in verifiable actions rather than vague or misleading rhetoric. Additionally, A3CG emphasizes cross-category generalization. This ensures robust model performance in aspect-action analysis even when companies change their reports to selectively favor certain sustainability areas.

However, this process traditionally relies on professionals who must be both legal experts and skilled translators -- creating bottlenecks and impacting effective access to justice. To address this challenge, we introduce SwiLTra-Bench, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark of over 180K aligned Swiss legal translation pairs comprising laws, headnotes, and press releases across all Swiss languages along with English, designed to evaluate LLM-based translation systems. Our systematic evaluation reveals that frontier models achieve superior translation performance across all document types, while specialized translation systems excel specifically in laws but under-perform in headnotes. Through rigorous testing and human expert validation, we demonstrate that while fine-tuning open SLMs significantly improves their translation quality, they still lag behind the best zero-shot prompted frontier models such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Additionally, we present SwiLTra-Judge, a specialized LLM evaluation system that aligns best with human expert assessments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01372v2
Two Intermediate Translations Are Better Than One: Fine-tuning LLMs for Document-level Translation Refinement,"['Yichen Dong', 'Xinglin Lyu', 'Junhui Li', 'Daimeng Wei', 'Min Zhang', 'Shimin Tao', 'Hao Yang']","Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) can enhance translation quality through self-refinement. In this paper, we build on this idea by extending the refinement from sentence-level to document-level translation, specifically focusing on document-to-document (Doc2Doc) translation refinement. Since sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent) and Doc2Doc translation address different aspects of the translation process, we propose fine-tuning LLMs for translation refinement using two intermediate translations, combining the strengths of both Sent2Sent and Doc2Doc. Additionally, recognizing that the quality of intermediate translations varies, we introduce an enhanced fine-tuning method with quality awareness that assigns lower weights to easier translations and higher weights to more difficult ones, enabling the model to focus on challenging translation cases. Experimental results across ten translation tasks with LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo-Instruct demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05614v1
Circuit Compositions: Exploring Modular Structures in Transformer-Based Language Models,"['Philipp Mondorf', 'Sondre Wold', 'Barbara Plank']","A fundamental question in interpretability research is to what extent neural networks, particularly language models, implement reusable functions through subnetworks that can be composed to perform more complex tasks. Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have made progress in identifying $\textit{circuits}$, which represent the minimal computational subgraphs responsible for a model's behavior on specific tasks. However, most studies focus on identifying circuits for individual tasks without investigating how functionally similar circuits $\textit{relate}$ to each other. To address this gap, we study the modularity of neural networks by analyzing circuits for highly compositional subtasks within a transformer-based language model. Specifically, given a probabilistic context-free grammar, we identify and compare circuits responsible for ten modular string-edit operations. Our results indicate that functionally similar circuits exhibit both notable node overlap and cross-task faithfulness. Moreover, we demonstrate that the circuits identified can be reused and combined through set operations to represent more complex functional model capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01434v3

These errors are fatal in some specialized domains such as medicine. Existing fact-checking with grounding documents methods face two main challenges: (1) they struggle to understand complex multihop relations in long documents, often overlooking subtle factual errors; (2) most specialized methods rely on pairwise comparisons, requiring multiple model calls, leading to high resource and computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose GraphCheck, a fact-checking framework that uses extracted knowledge graphs to enhance text representation. Graph Neural Networks further process these graphs as a soft prompt, enabling LLMs to incorporate structured knowledge more effectively. Enhanced with graph-based reasoning, GraphCheck captures multihop reasoning chains that are often overlooked by existing methods, enabling precise and efficient fact-checking in a single inference call. Experimental results on seven benchmarks spanning both general and medical domains demonstrate up to a 7.1% overall improvement over baseline models. Notably, GraphCheck outperforms existing specialized fact-checkers and achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art LLMs, such as DeepSeek-V3 and OpenAI-o1, with significantly fewer parameters.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16514v4

While existing optimization methods are effective in optimizing short prompts, they struggle with longer, more complex ones, often risking information loss and being sensitive to small perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose SCULPT (Systematic Tuning of Long Prompts), a framework that treats prompt optimization as a hierarchical tree refinement problem. SCULPT represents prompts as tree structures, enabling targeted modifications while preserving contextual integrity. It employs a Critic-Actor framework that generates reflections and applies actions to refine the prompt. Evaluations demonstrate SCULPT's effectiveness on long prompts, its robustness to adversarial perturbations, and its ability to generate high-performing prompts even without any initial human-written prompt. Compared to existing state of the art methods, SCULPT consistently improves LLM performance by preserving essential task information while applying structured refinements. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses show that SCULPT produces more stable and interpretable prompt modifications, ensuring better generalization across tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20788v2

This factuality ability is crucial in determining whether these models can be deployed and applied safely and compliantly within specific regions. To address these challenges and better evaluate the factuality ability of LLMs to answer short questions, we introduce the Chinese SafetyQA benchmark. Chinese SafetyQA has several properties (i.e., Chinese, Diverse, High-quality, Static, Easy-to-evaluate, Safety-related, Harmless).

Although safety alignment datasets have been introduced to mitigate such risks through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these datasets often lack comprehensive risk coverage. Most existing datasets focus primarily on lexical diversity while neglecting other critical dimensions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel analysis framework to systematically measure the risk coverage of alignment datasets across three essential dimensions: Lexical Diversity, Malicious Intent, and Jailbreak Tactics. We further introduce TRIDENT, an automated pipeline that leverages persona-based, zero-shot LLM generation to produce diverse and comprehensive instructions spanning these dimensions. Each harmful instruction is paired with an ethically aligned response, resulting in two datasets: TRIDENT-Core, comprising 26,311 examples, and TRIDENT-Edge, with 18,773 examples.

LLaVA Steering: Visual Instruction Tuning with 500x Fewer Parameters through Modality Linear Representation-Steering,"['Jinhe Bi', 'Yujun Wang', 'Haokun Chen', 'Xun Xiao', 'Artur Hecker', 'Volker Tresp', 'Yunpu Ma']","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced visual tasks by integrating visual representations into large language models (LLMs). The textual modality, inherited from LLMs, equips MLLMs with abilities like instruction following and in-context learning. In contrast, the visual modality enhances performance in downstream tasks by leveraging rich semantic content, spatial information, and grounding capabilities. These intrinsic modalities work synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research initially reveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text often dominating output generation during visual instruction tuning. This imbalance occurs when using both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. We then found that re-balancing these modalities can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters required, inspiring a direction for further optimizing visual instruction tuning. We introduce Modality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS) to achieve the goal. MoReS effectively re-balances the intrinsic modalities throughout the model, where the key idea is to steer visual representations through linear transformations in the visual subspace across each model layer. To validate our solution, we composed LLaVA Steering, a suite of models integrated with the proposed MoReS method. Evaluation results show that the composed LLaVA Steering models require, on average, 500 times fewer trainable parameters than LoRA needs while still achieving comparable performance across three visual benchmarks and eight visual question-answering tasks. Last, we present the LLaVA Steering Factory, an in-house developed platform that enables researchers to quickly customize various MLLMs with component-based architecture for seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art models, and evaluate their intrinsic modality imbalance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12359v2
Efficient Long Context Language Model Retrieval with Compression,"['Minju Seo', 'Jinheon Baek', 'Seongyun Lee', 'Sung Ju Hwang']","Long Context Language Models (LCLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm to perform Information Retrieval (IR), which enables the direct ingestion and retrieval of information by processing an entire corpus in their single context, showcasing the potential to surpass traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods. However, processing a large number of passages within in-context for retrieval is computationally expensive, and handling their representations during inference further exacerbates the processing time; thus, we aim to make LCLM retrieval more efficient and potentially more effective with passage compression. Specifically, we propose a new compression approach tailored for LCLM retrieval, which is trained to maximize the retrieval performance while minimizing the length of the compressed passages. To accomplish this, we generate the synthetic data, where compressed passages are automatically created and labeled as chosen or rejected according to their retrieval success for a given query, and we train the proposed Compression model for Long context Retrieval (CoLoR) with this data via preference optimization while adding the length regularization loss on top of it to enforce brevity. Through extensive experiments on 9 datasets, we show that CoLoR improves the retrieval performance by 6% while compressing the in-context size by a factor of 1.91.

Ontology-Guided Reverse Thinking Makes Large Language Models Stronger on Knowledge Graph Question Answering,"['Runxuan Liu', 'luobei', 'Jiaqi Li', 'Baoxin Wang', 'Ming Liu', 'Dayong Wu', 'Shijin Wang', 'Bing Qin']","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However, in knowledge graph question answering tasks (KGQA), there remains the issue of answering questions that require multi-hop reasoning. Existing methods rely on entity vector matching, but the purpose of the question is abstract and difficult to match with specific entities. As a result, it is difficult to establish reasoning paths to the purpose, which leads to information loss and redundancy. To address this issue, inspired by human reverse thinking, we propose Ontology-Guided Reverse Thinking (ORT), a novel framework that constructs reasoning paths from purposes back to conditions. ORT operates in three key phases: (1) using LLM to extract purpose labels and condition labels, (2) constructing label reasoning paths based on the KG ontology, and (3) using the label reasoning paths to guide knowledge retrieval. Experiments on the WebQSP and CWQ datasets show that ORT achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly enhances the capability of LLMs for KGQA.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11491v1

To overcome the limitation of existing datasets, we propose an automatic data collection pipeline that allows us to collect and annotate over 210 hours of human conversation videos. From this, we construct a Multi-Modal Face-to-Face (MM-F2F) human conversation dataset, including over 1.5M words and corresponding turn-taking and backchannel annotations from approximately 20M frames. Additionally, we present an end-to-end framework that predicts the probability of turn-taking and backchannel actions from multi-modal signals. The proposed model emphasizes the interrelation between modalities and supports any combination of text, audio, and video inputs, making it adaptable to a variety of realistic scenarios. Our experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on turn-taking and backchannel prediction tasks, achieving a 10% increase in F1-score on turn-taking and a 33% increase on backchannel prediction.

To bridge this gap, we introduce QAEdit, a new benchmark aligned with widely used question answering (QA) datasets, and WILD, a task-agnostic evaluation framework designed to better reflect real-world usage of model editing. Our single editing experiments show that current editing methods perform substantially worse than previously reported (38.5% vs. 96.8%). We demonstrate that it stems from issues in the synthetic evaluation practices of prior work. Among them, the most severe is the use of teacher forcing during testing, which leaks both content and length of the ground truth, leading to overestimated performance. Furthermore, we simulate practical deployment by sequential editing, revealing that current approaches fail drastically with only 1000 edits. This work calls for a shift in model editing research toward rigorous evaluation and the development of robust, scalable methods that can reliably update knowledge in LLMs for real-world use.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11177v5
LAQuer: Localized Attribution Queries in Content-grounded Generation,"['Eran Hirsch', 'Aviv Slobodkin', 'David Wan', 'Elias Stengel-Eskin', 'Mohit Bansal', 'Ido Dagan']","Grounded text generation models often produce content that deviates from their source material, requiring user verification to ensure accuracy. Existing attribution methods associate entire sentences with source documents, which can be overwhelming for users seeking to fact-check specific claims. In contrast, existing sub-sentence attribution methods may be more precise but fail to align with users' interests. In light of these limitations, we introduce Localized Attribution Queries (LAQuer), a new task that localizes selected spans of generated output to their corresponding source spans, allowing fine-grained and user-directed attribution. We compare two approaches for the LAQuer task, including prompting large language models (LLMs) and leveraging LLM internal representations. We then explore a modeling framework that extends existing attributed text generation methods to LAQuer. We evaluate this framework across two grounded text generation tasks: Multi-document Summarization (MDS) and Long-form Question Answering (LFQA). Our findings show that LAQuer methods significantly reduce the length of the attributed text. Our contributions include: (1) proposing the LAQuer task to enhance attribution usability, (2) suggesting a modeling framework and benchmarking multiple baselines, and (3) proposing a new evaluation setting to promote future research on localized attribution in content-grounded generation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01187v1

However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL),utilizing process rewards and iterative self-play. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks.

This indicates that these methods heavily rely on the intrinsic capabilities of hyper-scaled LLMs, rather than effectively retrieving useful demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for effectively retrieving demonstrations and generating SQL queries. We construct a Deep Contextual Schema Link Graph, which contains key information and semantic relationship between a question and its database schema items. This graph-based structure enables effective representation of Text-to-SQL samples and retrieval of useful demonstrations for in-context learning.

However, multilingual SLT (MLSLT) remains unexplored due to language conflicts and alignment difficulties across SLs and spoken languages. To address these challenges, we propose a multilingual gloss-free model with dual CTC objectives for token-level SL identification and spoken text generation.

An image restoration model is trained on this synthetic data, using multi-directional patch extraction and fusion to process large images. Second, a ByT5 post-OCR model, fine-tuned on synthetic historical text pairs, addresses remaining OCR errors. Detailed experiments on 13,831 pages of real historical documents in English, French, and Spanish show that the PreP-OCR pipeline reduces character error rates by 63.9-70.3% compared to OCR on raw images.

In few-shot aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), previous efforts have explored data augmentation techniques, which prompt LLMs to generate new samples by modifying existing ones.

Besides, some studies apply in-context learning for ABSA by using specific instructions and a few selected examples as prompts. Though promising, LLMs often yield labels that deviate from task requirements. To overcome these limitations, we propose DS$^2$-ABSA, a dual-stream data synthesis framework targeted for few-shot ABSA. It leverages LLMs to synthesize data from two complementary perspectives: \textit{key-point-driven} and \textit{instance-driven}, which effectively generate diverse and high-quality ABSA samples in low-resource settings.

Prior works have utilized this capability to improve smaller and cheaper LMs (say, with 7B parameters). However, various practical constraints, such as copyright and legal issues, owing to lack of transparency in the pre-training data of large (often closed) models, prevent their use in commercial settings. Little focus has been given to improving the innate reasoning ability of smaller models without distilling information from larger LLMs. To address this, we propose COLLATE, a trainable framework that tunes a (small) LLM to generate those outputs from a pool of diverse rationales that selectively improves the downstream task. COLLATE enforces multiple instances of the same LLM to exhibit distinct behavior and employs them to generate rationales to obtain diverse outputs. The LLM is then tuned via preference optimization to choose the candidate rationale which maximizes the likelihood of ground-truth answer. COLLATE outperforms several trainable and prompting baselines on 5 datasets across 3 domains: maths problem solving, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. We show the eff icacy of COLLATE on LLMs from different model families across varying parameter scales (1B to 8B) and demonstrate the benefit of multiple rationale providers guided by the end task through ablations.

This work focuses on aggregating predictions from multiple systems where no reference labels are available. A new method called SkillAggregation is proposed, which learns to combine estimates from LLM judges without needing additional data or ground truth.

MasRouter: Learning to Route LLMs for Multi-Agent Systems,"['Yanwei Yue', 'Guibin Zhang', 'Boyang Liu', 'Guancheng Wan', 'Kun Wang', 'Dawei Cheng', 'Yiyan Qi']","Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to push the boundaries of LLM capabilities, yet they often incur significant costs and face challenges in dynamic LLM selection. Current LLM routing methods effectively reduce overhead in single-agent scenarios by customizing LLM selection for each query, but they overlook the critical decisions regarding collaboration modes and agent roles in MAS. In response to this challenge, we first introduce the problem of Multi-Agent System Routing (MASR), which integrates all components of MAS into a unified routing framework. Toward this goal, we propose MasRouter, the first high-performing, cost-effective, and inductive MASR solution.

Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: Tailored Benchmarks for Efficient Evaluation,"['Peiwen Yuan', 'Yueqi Zhang', 'Shaoxiong Feng', 'Yiwei Li', 'Xinglin Wang', 'Jiayi Shi', 'Chuyi Tan', 'Boyuan Pan', 'Yao Hu', 'Kan Li']","Evaluating models on large benchmarks is very resource-intensive, especially during the period of rapid model evolution. Existing efficient evaluation methods estimate the performance of target models by testing them only on a small and static coreset of the benchmark, which is derived from the publicly available evaluation results of source models. These methods rely on the assumption that target models have high prediction consistency with source models. However, we demonstrate that it doesn't generalize well in practice. To alleviate the inconsistency issue, we present TailoredBench, a method that conducts customized evaluation tailored to each target model. Specifically, a Global-coreset is first constructed as a probe to identify the most consistent source models for each target model with an adaptive source model selection strategy. Afterwards, a scalable K-Medoids clustering algorithm is proposed to extend the Global-coreset to a tailored Native-coreset for each target model. According to the predictions on Native-coresets, we obtain the performance of target models on the whole benchmark with a calibrated estimation strategy. Comprehensive experiments on 5 benchmarks across over 300 models demonstrate that compared to best performing baselines, TailoredBench achieves an average reduction of 31.4% in MAE of accuracy estimates under the same inference budgets, showcasing strong effectiveness and generalizability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13576v2
Advancing Sequential Numerical Prediction in Autoregressive Models,"['Xiang Fei', 'Jinghui Lu', 'Qi Sun', 'Hao Feng', 'Yanjie Wang', 'Wei Shi', 'An-Lan Wang', 'Jingqun Tang', 'Can Huang']","Autoregressive models have become the de facto choice for sequence generation tasks, but standard approaches treat digits as independent tokens and apply cross-entropy loss, overlooking the coherent structure of numerical sequences. This paper introduces Numerical Token Integrity Loss (NTIL) to address this gap. NTIL operates at two levels: (1) token-level, where it extends the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to preserve ordinal relationships between numerical values, and (2) sequence-level, where it penalizes the overall discrepancy between the predicted and actual sequences. This dual approach improves numerical prediction and integrates effectively with LLMs/MLLMs. Extensive experiments show significant performance improvements with NTIL.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13077v2
iQUEST: An Iterative Question-Guided Framework for Knowledge Base Question Answering,"['Shuai Wang', 'Yinan Yu']","While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many natural language processing tasks, they often suffer from factual inaccuracies in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01784v2

However, it is unclear how well these models perform on tasks that require a combination of these skills. In this paper, we curate a novel program synthesis benchmark based on the XLogoOnline visual programming environment. The benchmark comprises 85 real-world tasks from the Mini-level of the XLogoOnline environment, each requiring a combination of different skills such as spatial planning, basic programming, and logical reasoning. Our evaluation shows that current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V and Llama3-70B struggle to solve these tasks, achieving only 20% and 2.35% success rates. Next, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline to boost the performance of models by leveraging a large-scale synthetic training dataset with over 80000 tasks. Moreover, we showcase how emulator-driven feedback can be used to design a curriculum over training data distribution. We showcase that a fine-tuned Llama3-8B drastically outperforms GPT-4V and Llama3-70B models, and provide an in-depth analysis of the models' expertise across different skill dimensions.

Removal of Hallucination on Hallucination: Debate-Augmented RAG,"['Wentao Hu', 'Wengyu Zhang', 'Yiyang Jiang', 'Chen Jason Zhang', 'Xiaoyong Wei', 'Li Qing']","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external knowledge, yet it introduces a critical issue: erroneous or biased retrieval can mislead generation, compounding hallucinations, a phenomenon we term Hallucination on Hallucination. To address this, we propose Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG), a training-free framework that integrates Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) mechanisms into both retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, DRAG employs structured debates among proponents, opponents, and judges to refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability. In generation, DRAG introduces asymmetric information roles and adversarial debates, enhancing reasoning robustness and mitigating factual inconsistencies. Evaluations across multiple tasks demonstrate that DRAG improves retrieval reliability, reduces RAG-induced hallucinations, and significantly enhances overall factual accuracy.

However, existing training methods like supervised fine-tuning face key limitations: they do not effectively teach models to prioritize correct over incorrect solutions in ambiguous situations, nor do they effectively optimize the runtime efficiency of the generated code. To address these challenges, we propose CodeDPO, a framework that integrates preference learning into code generation to improve two key code preference factors: code correctness and efficiency. CodeDPO employs a novel dataset construction method, utilizing a self-generation-and-validation mechanism that simultaneously generates and evaluates code and test cases. The underlying assumption is that test cases executable by multiple code snippets provide more reliable validation, and code that passes more tests is more likely to be correct. Through this self-validation process, our PageRank-inspired algorithm iteratively updates the ranking score of each code snippet, ultimately creating a code preference optimization dataset based on correctness and efficiency. CodeDPO is flexible and scalable, generating diverse preference optimization data without depending on external resources. Through comprehensive evaluations of five widely used benchmarks, CodeDPO demonstrates significant improvements in correctness and efficiency compared to existing methods. Our experiments prove that CodeDPO enhances the capabilities of LLMs in code generation and provides a robust foundation for conducting code preference optimization in more complex and challenging real-world scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05605v2
ProxAnn: Use-Oriented Evaluations of Topic Models and Document Clustering,"['Alexander Miserlis Hoyle', 'Lorena Calvo-Bartolomé', 'Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber', 'Philip Resnik']","Topic model and document-clustering evaluations either use automated metrics that align poorly with human preferences or require expert labels that are intractable to scale. We design a scalable human evaluation protocol and a corresponding automated approximation that reflect practitioners' real-world usage of models. Annotators -- or an LLM-based proxy -- review text items assigned to a topic or cluster, infer a category for the group, then apply that category to other documents. Using this protocol, we collect extensive crowdworker annotations of outputs from a diverse set of topic models on two datasets. We then use these annotations to validate automated proxies, finding that the best LLM proxies are statistically indistinguishable from a human annotator and can therefore serve as a reasonable substitute in automated evaluations.

While existing methods using embeddings from a diachronic corpus pair estimate the degree of change for target words, they offer limited insight into changes at the level of individual usage instances. To address this, we apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) to sets of contextualized word embeddings, capturing semantic change through the excess and deficit in the alignment between usage instances. In particular, we propose Sense Usage Shift (SUS), a measure that quantifies changes in the usage frequency of a word sense at each usage instance. By leveraging SUS, we demonstrate that several challenges in semantic change detection can be addressed in a unified manner, including quantifying instance-level semantic change and word-level tasks such as measuring the magnitude of semantic change and the broadening or narrowing of meaning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12569v2
Agentic Reward Modeling: Integrating Human Preferences with Verifiable Correctness Signals for Reliable Reward Systems,"['Hao Peng', 'Yunjia Qi', 'Xiaozhi Wang', 'Zijun Yao', 'Bin Xu', 'Lei Hou', 'Juanzi Li']","Reward models (RMs) are crucial for the training and inference-time scaling up of large language models (LLMs). However, existing reward models primarily focus on human preferences, neglecting verifiable correctness signals which have shown strong potential in training LLMs. In this paper, we propose agentic reward modeling, a reward system that combines reward models with verifiable correctness signals from different aspects to provide reliable rewards. We empirically implement a reward agent, named RewardAgent, that combines human preference rewards with two verifiable signals: factuality and instruction following, to provide more reliable rewards. We conduct comprehensive experiments on existing reward model benchmarks and inference time best-of-n searches on real-world downstream tasks. RewardAgent significantly outperforms vanilla reward models, demonstrating its effectiveness. We further construct training preference pairs using RewardAgent and train an LLM with the DPO objective, achieving superior performance on various NLP benchmarks compared to conventional reward models.

Designed with these constraints in mind, Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches propose to alter specific facts in pretrained models. However, they have been shown to suffer from several limitations, including their lack of contextual robustness and their failure to generalize to logical implications related to the fact. To overcome these issues, we propose SAKE, a steering activation method that models a fact to be edited as a distribution rather than a single prompt. Leveraging Optimal Transport, SAKE alters the LLM behavior over a whole fact-related distribution, defined as paraphrases and logical implications. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method: SAKE is thus able to perform more robust edits than its existing counterparts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01751v1
Middle-Layer Representation Alignment for Cross-Lingual Transfer in Fine-Tuned LLMs,"['Danni Liu', 'Jan Niehues']","While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities at task-specific applications through fine-tuning, extending these benefits across diverse languages is essential for broad accessibility. However, effective cross-lingual transfer is hindered by LLM performance gaps across languages and the scarcity of fine-tuning data in many languages. Through analysis of LLM internal representations from over 1,000+ language pairs, we discover that middle layers exhibit the strongest potential for cross-lingual alignment. Building on this finding, we propose a middle-layer alignment objective integrated into task-specific training. Our experiments on slot filling, machine translation, and structured text generation show consistent improvements in cross-lingual transfer, especially to lower-resource languages. The method is robust to the choice of alignment languages and generalizes to languages unseen during alignment. Furthermore, we show that separately trained alignment modules can be merged with existing task-specific modules, improving cross-lingual capabilities without full re-training.

While existing research primarily focuses on improving their accuracy, the efficiency remains underexplored. Given the real-time demands of many applications and the high inference overhead of VLMs, efficiency robustness is a critical issue. However, previous studies evaluate efficiency robustness under unrealistic assumptions, requiring access to the model architecture and parameters -- an impractical scenario in ML-as-a-service settings, where VLMs are deployed via inference APIs. To address this gap, we propose VLMInferSlow, a novel approach for evaluating VLM efficiency robustness in a realistic black-box setting. VLMInferSlow incorporates fine-grained efficiency modeling tailored to VLM inference and leverages zero-order optimization to search for adversarial examples. Experimental results show that VLMInferSlow generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations, increasing the computational cost by up to 128.47%.

The Alternative Annotator Test for LLM-as-a-Judge: How to Statistically Justify Replacing Human Annotators with LLMs,"['Nitay Calderon', 'Roi Reichart', 'Rotem Dror']","The ""LLM-as-an-annotator"" and ""LLM-as-a-judge"" paradigms employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as annotators, judges, and evaluators in tasks traditionally performed by humans. LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure, the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test), that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM annotators and judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming the open-source LLMs we examine, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality. We hope this study encourages more rigorous and reliable practices.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10970v3

To address this problem, weak-to-strong generalization aims to elicit the capabilities of strong models through weak supervisors and ensure that the behavior of strong models aligns with the intentions of weak supervisors without unsafe behaviors such as deception. Although weak-to-strong generalization exhibiting certain generalization capabilities, strong models exhibit significant overfitting in weak-to-strong generalization: Due to the strong fit ability of strong models, erroneous labels from weak supervisors may lead to overfitting in strong models. In addition, simply filtering out incorrect labels may lead to a degeneration in question quality, resulting in a weak generalization ability of strong models on hard questions. To mitigate overfitting in weak-to-strong generalization, we propose a two-stage framework that simultaneously improves the quality of supervision signals and the quality of input questions. Experimental results in three series of large language models and two mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly improves PGR compared to naive weak-to-strong generalization, even achieving up to 100\% PGR on some models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04249v1

Since Petroni et al. (2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an ``availability bias'' (Tversky&Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the analysis of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter's predisposition. To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materialize an LLM's factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation. Our approach is a milestone for LLM research, for the first time providing constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLM knowledge (or beliefs). As a prototype, we build GPTKB, a knowledge base (KB) comprising 101 million relational triples for over 2.9 million entities from GPT-4o-mini. We use GPTKB to exemplarily analyze GPT-4o-mini's factual knowledge in terms of scale, accuracy, bias, cutoff and consistency, at the same time.

Rhythm Controllable and Efficient Zero-Shot Voice Conversion via Shortcut Flow Matching,"['Jialong Zuo', 'Shengpeng Ji', 'Minghui Fang', 'Mingze Li', 'Ziyue Jiang', 'Xize Cheng', 'Xiaoda Yang', 'Chen Feiyang', 'Xinyu Duan', 'Zhou Zhao']","Zero-Shot Voice Conversion (VC) aims to transform the source speaker's timbre into an arbitrary unseen one while retaining speech content. Most prior work focuses on preserving the source's prosody, while fine-grained timbre information may leak through prosody, and transferring target prosody to synthesized speech is rarely studied. In light of this, we propose R-VC, a rhythm-controllable and efficient zero-shot voice conversion model. R-VC employs data perturbation techniques and discretize source speech into Hubert content tokens, eliminating much content-irrelevant information. By leveraging a Mask Generative Transformer for in-context duration modeling, our model adapts the linguistic content duration to the desired target speaking style, facilitating the transfer of the target speaker's rhythm. Furthermore, R-VC introduces a powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with shortcut flow matching during training, conditioning the network not only on the current noise level but also on the desired step size, enabling high timbre similarity and quality speech generation in fewer sampling steps, even in just two, thus minimizing latency. Experimental results show that R-VC achieves comparable speaker similarity to state-of-the-art VC methods with a smaller dataset, and surpasses them in terms of speech naturalness, intelligibility and style transfer performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01014v1
"Llama See, Llama Do: A Mechanistic Perspective on Contextual Entrainment and Distraction in LLMs","['Jingcheng Niu', 'Xingdi Yuan', 'Tong Wang', 'Hamidreza Saghir', 'Amir H. Abdi']","We observe a novel phenomenon, contextual entrainment, across a wide range of language models (LMs) and prompt settings, providing a new mechanistic perspective on how LMs become distracted by ``irrelevant'' contextual information in the input prompt. Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher logits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the context prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the relevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the sentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of contextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual prompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic factors. We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment heads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon. Using a novel entrainment head discovery method based on differentiable masking, we identify these heads across various settings. When we ``turn off'' these heads, i.e., set their outputs to zero, the effect of contextual entrainment is significantly attenuated, causing the model to generate output that capitulates to what it would produce if no distracting context were provided. Our discovery of contextual entrainment, along with our investigation into LM distraction via the entrainment heads, marks a key step towards the mechanistic analysis and mitigation of the distraction problem.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09338v2

Existing approaches rely on manually designed heuristics, the perplexity of existing models, training classifiers, or careful prompt engineering, which require significant expert experience and human annotation effort while introduce biases. We introduce CritiQ, a novel data selection method that automatically mines criteria from human preferences for data quality with only ~30 human-annotated pairs and performs efficient data selection. The main component, CritiQ Flow, employs a manager agent to evolve quality criteria and worker agents to make pairwise judgments. We build a knowledge base that extracts quality criteria from previous work to boost CritiQ Flow. Compared to perplexity- and classifier- based methods, verbal criteria are more interpretable and possess reusable value. After deriving the criteria, we train the CritiQ Scorer to give quality scores and perform efficient data selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the code, math, and logic domains, achieving high accuracy on human-annotated test sets. To validate the quality of the selected data, we continually train Llama 3.1 models and observe improved performance on downstream tasks compared to uniform sampling.

Theoretical Guarantees for Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding,"['Yuki Ichihara', 'Yuu Jinnai', 'Kaito Ariu', 'Tetsuro Morimura', 'Eiji Uchibe']","Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding optimizes output selection by maximizing the expected utility value of an underlying human distribution. While prior work has shown the effectiveness of MBR decoding through empirical evaluation, few studies have analytically investigated why the method is effective. As a result of our analysis, we show that, given the size $n$ of the reference hypothesis set used in computation, MBR decoding approaches the optimal solution with high probability at a rate of $O\left(n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, under certain assumptions, even though the language space $Y$ is significantly larger $|Y|\gg n$. This result helps to theoretically explain the strong performance observed in several prior empirical studies on MBR decoding. In addition, we provide the performance gap for maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) decoding and compare it to MBR decoding. The result of this paper indicates that MBR decoding tends to converge to the optimal solution faster than MAP decoding in several cases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12685v3
Mutual-Taught for Co-adapting Policy and Reward Models,"['Tianyuan Shi', 'Canbin Huang', 'Fanqi Wan', 'Longguang Zhong', 'Ziyi Yang', 'Weizhou Shen', 'Xiaojun Quan', 'Ming Yan']","During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs), distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model (PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal preference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update. This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1\% on AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06292v2

Recent advances in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have highlighted the effectiveness of adapting population-level LLMs to personalized LLMs by fine-tuning user-specific parameters with user history. However, user data is typically sparse, making it challenging to adapt LLMs to specific user patterns. To address this challenge, we propose PROgressive PERsonalization (PROPER), a novel progressive learning framework inspired by meso-level theory in social science. PROPER bridges population-level and user-level models by grouping users based on preferences and adapting LLMs in stages. It combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure with Low Ranked Adaptation (LoRA), using a user-aware router to assign users to appropriate groups automatically. Additionally, a LoRA-aware router is proposed to facilitate the integration of individual user LoRAs with group-level LoRAs. Experimental results show that PROPER significantly outperforms SOTA models across multiple tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01303v1

MMBoundary: Advancing MLLM Knowledge Boundary Awareness through Reasoning Step Confidence Calibration,"['Zhitao He', 'Sandeep Polisetty', 'Zhiyuan Fan', 'Shujin Wu', 'Yuchen Huang', 'Yi R. Fung']","In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23224v3
LIFBench: Evaluating the Instruction Following Performance and Stability of Large Language Models in Long-Context Scenarios,"['Xiaodong Wu', 'Minhao Wang', 'Yichen Liu', 'Xiaoming Shi', 'He Yan', 'Lu Xiangju', 'Junmin Zhu', 'Wei Zhang']","As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve in natural language processing (NLP), their ability to stably follow instructions in long-context inputs has become critical for real-world applications. However, existing benchmarks seldom focus on instruction-following in long-context scenarios or stability on different inputs. To bridge this gap, we introduce LIFBench, a scalable dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' instruction-following capabilities and stability across long contexts. LIFBench comprises three long-context scenarios and eleven diverse tasks, featuring 2,766 instructions generated through an automated expansion method across three dimensions: length, expression, and variables. For evaluation, we propose LIFEval, a rubric-based assessment method that enables precise, automated scoring of complex LLM responses without reliance on LLM-assisted assessments or human judgment. This method allows for a comprehensive analysis of model performance and stability from multiple perspectives. We conduct detailed experiments on 20 prominent LLMs across six length intervals. Our work contributes LIFBench and LIFEval as robust tools for assessing LLM performance in complex and long-context settings, offering valuable insights to guide future advancements in LLM development.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07037v2

Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers; however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual (DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2) DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency. Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%) into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19325v2

Specifically, ICP evaluates the LLM's understanding of the given instruction by calculating the tailored consistency among multiple self-generated responses. SEI further assesses the familiarity of the LLM with the target response by comparing it to the generated responses, using the proposed semantic clustering and well-designed voting strategy. Finally, to ensure the quality of selected samples, we introduce an expert-aligned reward model, considering characteristics beyond just familiarity.

One-Shot is Enough: Consolidating Multi-Turn Attacks into Efficient Single-Turn Prompts for LLMs,"['Junwoo Ha', 'Hyunjun Kim', 'Sangyoon Yu', 'Haon Park', 'Ashkan Yousefpour', 'Yuna Park', 'Suhyun Kim']","We introduce a novel framework for consolidating multi-turn adversarial ``jailbreak'' prompts into single-turn queries, significantly reducing the manual overhead required for adversarial testing of large language models (LLMs). While multi-turn human jailbreaks have been shown to yield high attack success rates, they demand considerable human effort and time. Our multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) methods -- Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize -- systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn prompts. Despite removing iterative back-and-forth interactions, these prompts preserve and often enhance adversarial potency: in extensive evaluations on the Multi-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset, M2S methods achieve attack success rates from 70.6 percent to 95.9 percent across several state-of-the-art LLMs. Remarkably, the single-turn prompts outperform the original multi-turn attacks by as much as 17.5 percentage points while cutting token usage by more than half on average. Further analysis shows that embedding malicious requests in enumerated or code-like structures exploits ``contextual blindness'', bypassing both native guardrails and external input-output filters. By converting multi-turn conversations into concise single-turn prompts, the M2S framework provides a scalable tool for large-scale red teaming and reveals critical weaknesses in contemporary LLM defenses.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04856v2
RAEmoLLM: Retrieval Augmented LLMs for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection Using In-Context Learning Based on Emotional Information,"['Zhiwei Liu', 'Kailai Yang', 'Qianqian Xie', 'Christine de Kock', 'Sophia Ananiadou', 'Eduard Hovy']","Misinformation is prevalent in various fields such as education, politics, health, etc., causing significant harm to society. However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on effort- and resource-intensive fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call {\em affect}). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. RAEmoLLM includes three modules. (1) In the index construction module, we apply an emotional LLM to obtain affective embeddings from all domains to construct a retrieval database. (2) The retrieval module uses the database to recommend top K examples (text-label pairs) from source domain data for target domain contents. (3) These examples are adopted as few-shot demonstrations for the inference module to process the target domain content. The RAEmoLLM can effectively enhance the general performance of LLMs in cross-domain misinformation detection tasks through affect-based retrieval, without fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the other few-shot methods on three datasets, with the highest increases of 15.64%, 31.18%, and 15.73% respectively.

CalibraEval: Calibrating Prediction Distribution to Mitigate Selection Bias in LLMs-as-Judges,"['Haitao Li', 'Junjie Chen', 'Qingyao Ai', 'Zhumin Chu', 'Yujia Zhou', 'Qian Dong', 'Yiqun LIU']","The use of large language models (LLMs) as automated evaluation tools to assess the quality of generated natural language, known as LLMs-as-Judges, has demonstrated promising capabilities and is rapidly gaining widespread attention. However, when applied to pairwise comparisons of candidate responses, LLM-based evaluators often exhibit selection bias. Specifically, their judgments may become inconsistent when the option positions or ID tokens are swapped, compromising the effectiveness and fairness of the evaluation result. To address this challenge, we introduce CalibraEval, a novel label-free method for mitigating selection bias during inference. Specifically, CalibraEval reformulates debiasing as an optimization task aimed at adjusting observed prediction distributions to align with unbiased prediction distributions. To solve this optimization problem, we propose a non-parametric order-preserving algorithm (NOA). This algorithm leverages the partial order relationships between model prediction distributions, thereby eliminating the need for explicit labels and precise mathematical function modeling.Empirical evaluations of LLMs in multiple representative benchmarks demonstrate that CalibraEval effectively mitigates selection bias and improves performance compared to existing debiasing methods. This work marks a step toward building more robust and unbiased automated evaluation frameworks, paving the way for improved reliability in AI-driven assessments",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15393v1
Explaining Matters: Leveraging Definitions and Semantic Expansion for Sexism Detection,"['Sahrish Khan', 'Gabriele Pergola', 'Arshad Jhumka']","The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation (DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion (CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5 points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained classification (Task C).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06238v1
Private Memorization Editing: Turning Memorization into a Defense to Strengthen Data Privacy in Large Language Models,"['Elena Sofia Ruzzetti', 'Giancarlo A.

In this paper, we introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs' memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the privacy attacks to zero.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10024v1

Does Time Have Its Place?

We discover Temporal Heads, specific attention heads that primarily handle temporal knowledge, through circuit analysis. We confirm that these heads are present across multiple models, though their specific locations may vary, and their responses differ depending on the type of knowledge and its corresponding years. Disabling these heads degrades the model's ability to recall time-specific knowledge while maintaining its general capabilities without compromising time-invariant and question-answering performances. Moreover, the heads are activated not only numeric conditions (""In 2004"") but also textual aliases (""In the year ...""), indicating that they encode a temporal dimension beyond simple numerical representation. Furthermore, we expand the potential of our findings by demonstrating how temporal knowledge can be edited by adjusting the values of these heads.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14258v2

In general, previous efforts resort to sampling training data from different domains with static proportions, as well as adjusting data proportions during training. However, few methods have addressed the complexities of domain-adaptive continual pre-training. To fill this gap, we propose Velocitune, a novel framework dynamically assesses learning velocity and adjusts data proportions accordingly, favoring slower-learning domains while shunning faster-learning ones, which is guided by a scaling law to indicate the desired learning goal for each domain with less associated cost. To evaluate the effectiveness of Velocitune, we conduct experiments in a reasoning-focused dataset with CodeLlama, as well as in a corpus specialised for system command generation with Llama3 and Mistral. Velocitune achieves performance gains in both math and code reasoning tasks and command-line generation benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that key factors driving Velocitune's effectiveness include target loss prediction and data ordering.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14318v2

Existing model editing methods, especially those that alter model parameters, typically focus on single-round editing and often face significant challenges in sequential model editing-most notably issues of model forgetting and failure. To address these challenges, we introduce a new model editing method, namely \textbf{N}euron-level \textbf{S}equential \textbf{E}diting (NSE), tailored for supporting sequential model editing. Specifically, we optimize the target layer's hidden states using the model's original weights to prevent model failure.

SimulS2S-LLM: Unlocking Simultaneous Inference of Speech LLMs for Speech-to-Speech Translation,"['Keqi Deng', 'Wenxi Chen', 'Xie Chen', 'Phil Woodland']","Simultaneous speech translation (SST) outputs translations in parallel with streaming speech input, balancing translation quality and latency. While large language models (LLMs) have been extended to handle the speech modality, streaming remains challenging as speech is prepended as a prompt for the entire generation process. To unlock LLM streaming capability, this paper proposes SimulS2S-LLM, which trains speech LLMs offline and employs a test-time policy to guide simultaneous inference. SimulS2S-LLM alleviates the mismatch between training and inference by extracting boundary-aware speech prompts that allows it to be better matched with text input data. SimulS2S-LLM achieves simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (Simul-S2ST) by predicting discrete output speech tokens and then synthesising output speech using a pre-trained vocoder. An incremental beam search is designed to expand the search space of speech token prediction without increasing latency. Experiments on the CVSS speech data show that SimulS2S-LLM offers a better translation quality-latency trade-off than existing methods that use the same training data, such as improving ASR-BLEU scores by 3 points at similar latency.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15509v1
VoxEval: Benchmarking the Knowledge Understanding Capabilities of End-to-End Spoken Language Models,"['Wenqian Cui', 'Xiaoqi Jiao', 'Ziqiao Meng', 'Irwin King']","With the rising need for speech-based interaction models, end-to-end Spoken Language Models (SLMs) have emerged as a promising solution.

To address these limitations, we present VoxEval, a novel SpeechQA benchmark that assesses SLMs' knowledge understanding through pure speech interactions. Our benchmark 1) uniquely maintains speech format for both inputs and outputs, 2) evaluates model robustness across diverse input audio conditions, and 3) pioneers the assessment of complex tasks like mathematical reasoning in spoken format. Systematic evaluation demonstrates that VoxEval presents significant challenges to current SLMs, revealing their sensitivity to varying audio conditions and highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in future development.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an effective solution by incorporating external knowledge, but existing methods still face several limitations: additional deployment costs of separate retrievers, redundant input tokens from retrieved text chunks, and the lack of joint optimization of retrieval and generation. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RetroLLM}, a unified framework that integrates retrieval and generation into a single, cohesive process, enabling LLMs to directly generate fine-grained evidence from the corpus with constrained decoding. Moreover, to mitigate false pruning in the process of constrained evidence generation, we introduce (1) hierarchical FM-Index constraints, which generate corpus-constrained clues to identify a subset of relevant documents before evidence generation, reducing irrelevant decoding space; and (2) a forward-looking constrained decoding strategy, which considers the relevance of future sequences to improve evidence accuracy.

Our theoretical and empirical results highlight the crucial role of representations: better representations, e.g., training gradients, generally lead to a better selection of instances, regardless of the chosen selection algorithm. Furthermore, different selection algorithms excel in different settings, and none consistently outperforms the others.

In this work, we introduce methods to disaggregate response-level labels into sentence-level (pseudo-)labels. Our approach leverages multiple instance learning (MIL) and learning from label proportions (LLP) techniques in conjunction with prior information (e.g., document-sentence cosine similarity) to train a specialized model for sentence-level scoring. We also employ techniques which use model predictions to pseudo-label the train-set at the sentence-level for model training to further improve performance. We conduct extensive evaluations of our methods across six datasets and four tasks: retrieval, question answering, summarization, and math reasoning. Our results demonstrate improved performance compared to multiple baselines across most of these tasks.

In this paper, we propose a novel iterative sampling framework for text length control, integrating the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with an importance sampling acceleration strategy. This framework efficiently and reliably regulates LLMs to generate length-constrained text without modifying the underlying parameters, thereby preserving the original capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves almost 100\% success rates of length control on Llama3.1 for tasks such as length-controlled abstractive summarization and length-constrained instruction following, with minimal additional computational overhead.

Providing this information is the task of context attribution. In this paper, we systematically study LLM-based approaches for this task, namely we investigate (i) zero-shot inference, (ii) LLM ensembling, and (iii) fine-tuning of small LMs on synthetic data generated by larger LLMs. Our key contribution is SynQA: a novel generative strategy for synthesizing context attribution data. Given selected context sentences, an LLM generates QA pairs that are supported by these sentences. This leverages LLMs' natural strengths in text generation while ensuring clear attribution paths in the synthetic training data. We show that the attribution data synthesized via SynQA is highly effective for fine-tuning small LMs for context attribution in different QA tasks and domains. Finally, with a user study, we validate the usefulness of small LMs (fine-tuned on synthetic data from SynQA) in context attribution for QA.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05317v2

Supervised Fine-Tuning Achieve Rapid Task Adaption Via Alternating Attention Head Activation Patterns,"['Yang Zhao', 'Li Du', 'Xiao Ding', 'Kai Xiong', 'Ting Liu', 'Bing Qin']","LLMs' performance on complex tasks is still unsatisfactory. A key issue is that presently LLMs learn in a data-driven schema, while the instructions about these complex tasks are both scarce and hard to collect or construct. On the contrary, a prominent phenomenon is that LLMs can learn rather fast on simpler tasks with adequate prior knowledge captured during pretraining stage. Thus, if the prerequisite and mechanism of such rapid generalization could be elucidated, it could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the LLM's ability to learn complex tasks. Thus, in this paper, we employ a gradient-based method, to dissect the process that the SFT process adapts LLMs to downstream tasks via the perspective of attention patterns. We find that: (1) LLMs selectively activate task-specific attention heads during SFT; (2) activation patterns for complex tasks are combinations of basic task patterns; and (3) changes in a few parameters can significantly impact activation patterns after SFT on a small number of samples.Based on these insights, experiments are conducted to actually enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of SFT.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15820v2

Existing datasets, such as TravelPlanner and TravelPlanner+, suffer from semi synthetic data reliance, spatial inconsistencies, and a lack of key travel constraints, making them inadequate for practical itinerary generation. To address these gaps, we introduce TripCraft, a spatiotemporally coherent travel planning dataset that integrates real world constraints, including public transit schedules, event availability, diverse attraction categories, and user personas for enhanced personalization. To evaluate LLM generated plans beyond existing binary validation methods, we propose five continuous evaluation metrics, namely Temporal Meal Score, Temporal Attraction Score, Spatial Score, Ordering Score, and Persona Score which assess itinerary quality across multiple dimensions. Our parameter informed setting significantly enhances meal scheduling, improving the Temporal Meal Score from 61% to 80% in a 7 day scenario. TripCraft establishes a new benchmark for LLM driven personalized travel planning, offering a more realistic, constraint aware framework for itinerary generation.

To fill this gap, we introduce FEA-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform incremental development within code repositories. We collect pull requests from 83 GitHub repositories and use rule-based and intent-based filtering to construct task instances focused on new feature development. Each task instance containing code changes is paired with relevant unit test files to ensure that the solution can be verified. The feature implementation requires LLMs to simultaneously possess code completion capabilities for new components and code editing abilities for other relevant parts in the code repository, providing a more comprehensive evaluation method of LLMs' automated software engineering capabilities. Experimental results show that LLMs perform significantly worse in the FEA-Bench, highlighting considerable challenges in such repository-level incremental code development.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06680v2
Do not Abstain! Identify and Solve the Uncertainty,"['Jingyu Liu', 'JingquanPeng', 'xiaopeng Wu', 'Xubin Li', 'Tiezheng Ge', 'Bo Zheng', 'Yong Liu']","Despite the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, they frequently exhibit overconfidence when encountering uncertain scenarios, yet existing solutions primarily rely on evasive responses (e.g., ""I don't know"") overlooks the opportunity of identifying and addressing the uncertainty to generate more satisfactory responses. To systematically investigate and improve LLMs' ability of recognizing and addressing the source of uncertainty, we introduce \textbf{ConfuseBench}, a benchmark mainly focus on three types of uncertainty: document scarcity, limited capability, and query ambiguity. Experiments with ConfuseBench reveal that current LLMs struggle to accurately identify the root cause of uncertainty and solve it. They prefer to attribute uncertainty to query ambiguity while overlooking capability limitations, especially for those weaker models. To tackle this challenge, we first generate context-aware inquiries that highlight the confusing aspect of the original query. Then we judge the source of uncertainty based on the uniqueness of the inquiry's answer. Further we use an on-policy training method, InteractDPO to generate better inquiries. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00780v1

Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions,"['Leonardo Ranaldi', 'Marco Valentino', 'Andre Freitas']","Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12616v1
Information Extraction from Visually Rich Documents using LLM-based Organization of Documents into Independent Textual Segments,"['Aniket Bhattacharyya', 'Anurag Tripathi', 'Ujjal Das', 'Archan Karmakar', 'Amit Pathak', 'Maneesh Gupta']","Information extraction (IE) from Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) containing layout features along with text is a critical and well-studied task. Specialized non-LLM NLP-based solutions typically involve training models using both textual and geometric information to label sequences/tokens as named entities or answers to specific questions. However, these approaches lack reasoning, are not able to infer values not explicitly present in documents, and do not generalize well to new formats. Generative LLM-based approaches proposed recently are capable of reasoning, but struggle to comprehend clues from document layout especially in previously unseen document formats, and do not show competitive performance in heterogeneous VRD benchmark datasets. In this paper, we propose BLOCKIE, a novel LLM-based approach that organizes VRDs into localized, reusable semantic textual segments called $\textit{semantic blocks}$, which are processed independently. Through focused and more generalizable reasoning,our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on public VRD benchmarks by 1-3% in F1 scores, is resilient to document formats previously not encountered and shows abilities to correctly extract information not explicitly present in documents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13535v1

Previous research on Large Language Model (LLM)-based SPs mostly focuses on improving data retrieval accuracy or adjusting prompts through human feedback. However, this focus has overlooked the critical need for patient agents to learn a standardized presentation pattern that transforms data into human-like patient responses through unsupervised simulations. To address this gap, we propose EvoPatient, a novel simulated patient framework in which a patient agent and doctor agents simulate the diagnostic process through multi-turn dialogues, simultaneously gathering experience to improve the quality of both questions and answers, ultimately enabling human doctor training. Extensive experiments on various cases demonstrate that, by providing only overall SP requirements, our framework improves over existing reasoning methods by more than 10\% in requirement alignment and better human preference, while achieving an optimal balance of resource consumption after evolving over 200 cases for 10 hours, with excellent generalizability.

Donate or Create? Comparing Data Collection Strategies for Emotion-labeled Multimodal Social Media Posts,"['Christopher Bagdon', 'Aidan Combs', 'Carina Silberer', 'Roman Klinger']","Accurate modeling of subjective phenomena such as emotion expression requires data annotated with authors' intentions. Commonly such data is collected by asking study participants to donate and label genuine content produced in the real world, or create content fitting particular labels during the study. Asking participants to create content is often simpler to implement and presents fewer risks to participant privacy than data donation. However, it is unclear if and how study-created content may differ from genuine content, and how differences may impact models. We collect study-created and genuine multimodal social media posts labeled for emotion and compare them on several dimensions, including model performance. We find that compared to genuine posts, study-created posts are longer, rely more on their text and less on their images for emotion expression, and focus more on emotion-prototypical events. The samples of participants willing to donate versus create posts are demographically different. Study-created data is valuable to train models that generalize well to genuine data, but realistic effectiveness estimates require genuine data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24427v1
Which Demographics do LLMs Default to During Annotation?,"['Johannes Schäfer', 'Aidan Combs', 'Christopher Bagdon', 'Jiahui Li', 'Nadine Probol', 'Lynn Greschner', 'Sean Papay', 'Yarik Menchaca Resendiz', 'Aswathy Velutharambath', 'Amelie Wuehrl', 'Sabine Weber', 'Roman Klinger']","Demographics and cultural background of annotators influence the labels they assign in text annotation -- for instance, an elderly woman might find it offensive to read a message addressed to a ""bro"", but a male teenager might find it appropriate. It is therefore important to acknowledge label variations to not under-represent members of a society. Two research directions developed out of this observation in the context of using large language models (LLM) for data annotations, namely (1) studying biases and inherent knowledge of LLMs and (2) injecting diversity in the output by manipulating the prompt with demographic information. We combine these two strands of research and ask the question to which demographics an LLM resorts to when no demographics is given. To answer this question, we evaluate which attributes of human annotators LLMs inherently mimic. Furthermore, we compare non-demographic conditioned prompts and placebo-conditioned prompts (e.g., ""you are an annotator who lives in house number 5"") to demographics-conditioned prompts (""You are a 45 year old man and an expert on politeness annotation. How do you rate {instance}""). We study these questions for politeness and offensiveness annotations on the POPQUORN data set, a corpus created in a controlled manner to investigate human label variations based on demographics which has not been used for LLM-based analyses so far. We observe notable influences related to gender, race, and age in demographic prompting, which contrasts with previous studies that found no such effects.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08820v3

This is probably because there is no rational explanation for whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05000v1
Table-Critic: A Multi-Agent Framework for Collaborative Criticism and Refinement in Table Reasoning,"['Peiying Yu', 'Guoxin Chen', 'Jingjing Wang']","Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in various reasoning tasks, they still struggle with table reasoning tasks, particularly in maintaining consistency throughout multi-step reasoning processes. While existing approaches have explored various decomposition strategies, they often lack effective mechanisms to identify and correct errors in intermediate reasoning steps, leading to cascading error propagation. To address these issues, we propose Table-Critic, a novel multi-agent framework that facilitates collaborative criticism and iterative refinement of the reasoning process until convergence to correct solutions. Our framework consists of four specialized agents: a Judge for error identification, a Critic for comprehensive critiques, a Refiner for process improvement, and a Curator for pattern distillation. To effectively deal with diverse and unpredictable error types, we introduce a self-evolving template tree that systematically accumulates critique knowledge through experience-driven learning and guides future reflections. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that Table-Critic achieves substantial improvements over existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and error correction rates while maintaining computational efficiency and lower solution degradation rate.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11799v3

However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data. To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data. Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., ""nutrition fact labels""), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images. With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM. Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art performance among competitive open-source models, including Llama 3.2, and surpass proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash.

However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3) Appropriately difficulty and high-quality.

A key component of agents is memory, which stores vital information but is susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing research mainly focuses on single-agent attacks and shared memory attacks. However, real-world scenarios often involve independent memory. In this paper, we propose the Troublemaker Makes Chaos in Honest Town (TMCHT) task, a large-scale, multi-agent, multi-topology text-based attack evaluation framework. TMCHT involves one attacker agent attempting to mislead an entire society of agents. We identify two major challenges in multi-agent attacks: (1) Non-complete graph structure, (2) Large-scale systems. We attribute these challenges to a phenomenon we term toxicity disappearing. To address these issues, we propose an Adversarial Replication Contagious Jailbreak (ARCJ) method, which optimizes the retrieval suffix to make poisoned samples more easily retrieved and optimizes the replication suffix to make poisoned samples have contagious ability. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach in TMCHT, with 23.51%, 18.95%, and 52.93% improvements in line topology, star topology, and 100-agent settings.

Meta-Learning Neural Mechanisms rather than Bayesian Priors,"['Michael Eric Goodale', 'Salvador Mascarenhas', 'Yair Lakretz']","Children acquire language despite being exposed to several orders of magnitude less data than large language models require. Meta-learning has been proposed as a way to integrate human-like learning biases into neural-network architectures, combining both the structured generalizations of symbolic models with the scalability of neural-network models. But what does meta-learning exactly imbue the model with? We investigate the meta-learning of formal languages and find that, contrary to previous claims, meta-trained models are not learning simplicity-based priors when meta-trained on datasets organised around simplicity. Rather, we find evidence that meta-training imprints neural mechanisms (such as counters) into the model, which function like cognitive primitives for the network on downstream tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that meta-training on a single formal language can provide as much improvement to a model as meta-training on 5000 different formal languages, provided that the formal language incentivizes the learning of useful neural mechanisms. Taken together, our findings provide practical implications for efficient meta-learning paradigms and new theoretical insights into linking symbolic theories and neural mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16048v2

We showcase the utility of MAPS for answering two types of questions: (a) given a predefined operation, mapping how strongly heads across the model implement it, and (b) given an attention head, inferring its salient functionality. Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular LLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head's outputs during inference and are causally linked to the model's predictions. Moreover, its mappings reveal attention heads of certain operations that were overlooked in previous studies, and valuable insights on function universality and architecture biases in LLMs. Next, we present an automatic pipeline and analysis that leverage MAPS to characterize the salient operations of a given head.

Dennis', 'Andre Freitas']","Natural language explanations play a fundamental role in Natural Language Inference (NLI) by revealing how premises logically entail hypotheses. Recent work has shown that the interaction of large language models (LLMs) with theorem provers (TPs) can help verify and improve the validity of NLI explanations. However, TPs require translating natural language into machine-verifiable formal representations, a process that introduces the risk of semantic information loss and unfaithful interpretation, an issue compounded by LLMs' challenges in capturing critical logical structures with sufficient precision. Moreover, LLMs are still limited in their capacity for rigorous and robust proof construction within formal verification frameworks. To mitigate issues related to faithfulness and robustness, this paper investigates strategies to (1) alleviate semantic loss during autoformalisation, (2) efficiently identify and correct syntactic errors in logical representations, (3) explicitly use logical expressions to guide LLMs in generating structured proof sketches, and (4) increase LLMs' capacity of interpreting TP's feedback for iterative refinement. Our empirical results on e-SNLI, QASC and WorldTree using different LLMs demonstrate that the proposed strategies yield significant improvements in autoformalisation (+18.46%, +34.2%, +39.77%) and explanation refinement (+29.5%, +51.5%, +41.25%) over the state-of-the-art model. Moreover, we show that specific interventions on the hybrid LLM-TP architecture can substantially improve efficiency, drastically reducing the number of iterations required for successful verification.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24264v1
Revealing the Deceptiveness of Knowledge Editing: A Mechanistic Analysis of Superficial Editing,"['Jiakuan Xie', 'Pengfei Cao', 'Yubo Chen', 'Kang Liu', 'Jun Zhao']","Knowledge editing, which aims to update the knowledge encoded in language models, can be deceptive. Despite the fact that many existing knowledge editing algorithms achieve near-perfect performance on conventional metrics, the models edited by them are still prone to generating original knowledge. This paper introduces the concept of ""superficial editing"" to describe this phenomenon. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that this issue presents a significant challenge to existing algorithms. Through systematic investigation, we identify and validate two key factors contributing to this issue: (1) the residual stream at the last subject position in earlier layers and (2) specific attention modules in later layers. Notably, certain attention heads in later layers, along with specific left singular vectors in their output matrices, encapsulate the original knowledge and exhibit a causal relationship with superficial editing. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the task of superficial unlearning, where we observe consistent patterns in the behavior of specific attention heads and their corresponding left singular vectors, thereby demonstrating the robustness and broader applicability of our methodology and conclusions. Our code is available here.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12636v1
Masking in Multi-hop QA: An Analysis of How Language Models Perform with Context Permutation,"['Wenyu Huang', 'Pavlos Vougiouklis', 'Mirella Lapata', 'Jeff Z. Pan']","Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) adds layers of complexity to question answering, making it more challenging. When Language Models (LMs) are prompted with multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant information but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information sources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the causal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In this paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting search results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study reveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the ones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in MHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order of gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned decoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order aligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models with bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively boost their end performance. In addition to the above, we conduct a thorough investigation of the distribution of LM attention weights in the context of MHQA. Our experiments reveal that attention weights tend to peak at higher values when the resulting answer is correct. We leverage this finding to heuristically improve LMs' performance on this task. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hwy9855/MultiHopQA-Reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11754v1

Optimizing Question Semantic Space for Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Multi-hop Question Answering,"['LINHAO YE', 'Qin Chen', 'Jie Zhou', 'Lang Yu', 'Zhikai Lei', 'Liang He']","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is usually integrated into large language models (LLMs) to mitigate hallucinations and knowledge obsolescence. Whereas,conventional one-step retrieve-and-read methods are insufficient for multi-hop question answering, facing challenges of retrieval semantic mismatching and the high cost in handling interdependent subquestions. In this paper, we propose Optimizing Question Semantic Space for Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Multi-hop Question Answering (Q-DREAM). Q-DREAM consists of three key modules: (1) the Question Decomposition Module (QDM), which decomposes multi-hop questions into fine-grained subquestions; (2) the Subquestion Dependency Optimizer Module (SDOM), which models the interdependent relations of subquestions for better understanding; and (3) the Dynamic Passage Retrieval Module (DPRM), which aligns subquestions with relevant passages by optimizing the semantic embeddings. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that Q-DREAM significantly outperforms existing RAG methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Notably, Q-DREAM also improves retrieval efficiency while maintaining high accuracy compared with recent baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00491v1

To study this issue, we introduce an automated framework, augmented with human-in-the-loop quality control, to generate inputs designed to simulate and evaluate these conflicts in MLLMs. Using this framework, we have crafted a diagnostic benchmark consisting of 374 original images and 1,122 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs. The benchmark covers two aspects of conflict and three question types, providing a thorough assessment tool. We apply this benchmark to assess the conflict-resolution capabilities of nine representative MLLMs from various model families. Our results indicate an evident over-reliance on parametric knowledge for approximately 20% of all queries, especially among Yes-No and action-related problems. Based on these findings, we evaluate the effectiveness of existing approaches to mitigating the conflicts and compare them to our ""Focus-on-Vision"" prompting strategy. Despite some improvement, the vision-knowledge conflict remains unresolved and can be further scaled through our data construction framework. Our proposed framework, benchmark, and analysis contribute to the understanding and mitigation of vision-knowledge conflicts in MLLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08145v2
SceneGenAgent: Precise Industrial Scene Generation with Coding Agent,"['Xiao Xia', 'Dan Zhang', 'Zibo Liao', 'Zhenyu Hou', 'Tianrui Sun', 'Jing Li', 'Ling Fu', 'Yuxiao Dong']","The modeling of industrial scenes is essential for simulations in industrial manufacturing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent.

Existing approaches face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-crafted prompts, difficulty in multi-step planning, and lack of precise error diagnosis and reflection mechanisms. We propose ToolCoder, a novel framework that reformulates tool learning as a code generation task. Inspired by software engineering principles, ToolCoder transforms natural language queries into structured Python function scaffold and systematically breaks down tasks with descriptive comments, enabling LLMs to leverage coding paradigms for complex reasoning and planning. It then generates and executes function implementations to obtain final responses. Additionally, ToolCoder stores successfully executed functions in a repository to promote code reuse, while leveraging error traceback mechanisms for systematic debugging, optimizing both execution efficiency and robustness.

Enhancing Text Editing for Grammatical Error Correction: Arabic as a Case Study,"['Bashar Alhafni', 'Nizar Habash']","Text editing frames grammatical error correction (GEC) as a sequence tagging problem, where edit tags are assigned to input tokens, and applying these edits results in the corrected text. This approach has gained attention for its efficiency and interpretability. However, while extensively explored for English, text editing remains largely underexplored for morphologically rich languages like Arabic. In this paper, we introduce a text editing approach that derives edit tags directly from data, eliminating the need for language-specific edits. We demonstrate its effectiveness on Arabic, a diglossic and morphologically rich language, and investigate the impact of different edit representations on model performance. Our approach achieves SOTA results on two Arabic GEC benchmarks and performs on par with SOTA on two others. Additionally, our models are over six times faster than existing Arabic GEC systems, making our approach more practical for real-world applications. Finally, we explore ensemble models, demonstrating how combining different models leads to further performance improvements.

From Isolates to Families: Using Neural Networks for Automated Language Affiliation,"['Frederic Blum', 'Steffen Herbold', 'Johann-Mattis List']","In historical linguistics, the affiliation of languages to a common language family is traditionally carried out using a complex workflow that relies on manually comparing individual languages. Large-scale standardized collections of multilingual wordlists and grammatical language structures might help to improve this and open new avenues for developing automated language affiliation workflows. Here, we present neural network models that use lexical and grammatical data from a worldwide sample of more than 1,000 languages with known affiliations to classify individual languages into families. In line with the traditional assumption of most linguists, our results show that models trained on lexical data alone outperform models solely based on grammatical data, whereas combining both types of data yields even better performance. In additional experiments, we show how our models can identify long-ranging relations between entire subgroups, how they can be employed to investigate potential relatives of linguistic isolates, and how they can help us to obtain first hints on the affiliation of so far unaffiliated languages. We conclude that models for automated language affiliation trained on lexical and grammatical data provide comparative linguists with a valuable tool for evaluating hypotheses about deep and unknown language relations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11688v1

"Less, but Better: Efficient Multilingual Expansion for LLMs via Layer-wise Mixture-of-Experts","['Xue Zhang', 'Yunlong Liang', 'Fandong Meng', 'Songming Zhang', 'Yufeng Chen', 'Jinan Xu', 'Jie Zhou']","Continually expanding new languages for existing large language models (LLMs) is a promising yet challenging approach to building powerful multilingual LLMs. The biggest challenge is to make the model continuously learn new languages while preserving the proficient ability of old languages. To achieve this, recent work utilizes the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to expand new languages by adding new experts and avoid catastrophic forgetting of old languages by routing corresponding tokens to the original model backbone (old experts). Although intuitive, this kind of method is parameter-costly when expanding new languages and still inevitably impacts the performance of old languages. To address these limitations, we analyze the language characteristics of different layers in LLMs and propose a layer-wise expert allocation algorithm (LayerMoE) to determine the appropriate number of new experts for each layer. Specifically, we find different layers in LLMs exhibit different representation similarities between languages and then utilize the similarity as the indicator to allocate experts for each layer, i.e., the higher similarity, the fewer experts. Additionally, to further mitigate the forgetting of old languages, we add a classifier in front of the router network on the layers with higher similarity to guide the routing of old language tokens. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art baseline with 60% fewer experts in the single-expansion setting and with 33.3% fewer experts in the lifelong-expansion setting, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22582v1
When Harry Meets Superman: The Role of The Interlocutor in Persona-Based Dialogue Generation,"['Daniela Occhipinti', 'Marco Guerini', 'Malvina Nissim']","Endowing dialogue agents with persona information has proven to significantly improve the consistency and diversity of their generations. While much focus has been placed on aligning dialogues with provided personas, the adaptation to the interlocutor's profile remains largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate three key aspects: (1) a model's ability to align responses with both the provided persona and the interlocutor's; (2) its robustness when dealing with familiar versus unfamiliar interlocutors and topics, and (3) the impact of additional fine-tuning on specific persona-based dialogues. We evaluate dialogues generated with diverse speaker pairings and topics, framing the evaluation as an author identification task and employing both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations. By systematically masking or disclosing information about the interlocutor, we assess its impact on dialogue generation. Results show that access to the interlocutor's persona improves the recognition of the target speaker, while masking it does the opposite. Although models generalise well across topics, they struggle with unfamiliar interlocutors. Finally, we found that in zero-shot settings, LLMs often copy biographical details, facilitating identification but trivialising the task.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24613v1

Recently, the notion of self-debugging has been proposed to boost the performance of code generation by leveraging execution feedback from tests. Despite its promise, the availability of high-quality tests in real-world scenarios is limited. In this context, self-debugging with self-generated tests is a promising solution but lacks a full exploration of its limitations and practical potential. Therefore, we investigate its efficacy on diverse programming problems. To deepen our understanding, we propose two distinct paradigms for the process: post-execution and in-execution self-debugging. Within the scope of self-contained Python programming tasks, we find that post-execution self-debugging struggles on basic problems but shows potential for improvement on competitive ones, due to the bias introduced by self-generated tests. On the other hand, in-execution self-debugging enables LLMs to mitigate the bias by solely leveraging intermediate states during execution, thereby enhancing code generation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12793v1

Nonetheless, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in adhering to speech instructions. Notably, the intelligence of models significantly diminishes when processing speech-form input as compared to direct text-form input. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this semantic inconsistency between speech and text representations through techniques such as representation and behavior alignment, which involve the meticulous design of data pairs during the post-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a simple and scalable training method called InSerter, which stands for Interleaved Speech-Text Representation Pre-training. InSerter is designed to pre-train large-scale unsupervised speech-text sequences, where the speech is synthesized from randomly selected segments of an extensive text corpus using text-to-speech conversion. Consequently, the model acquires the ability to generate textual continuations corresponding to the provided speech segments, obviating the need for intensive data design endeavors.

Enhancing Spoken Discourse Modeling in Language Models Using Gestural Cues,"['Varsha Suresh', 'M.

For example, speakers perform hand gestures to indicate topic shifts, helping listeners identify transitions in discourse. In this work, we investigate whether the joint modeling of gestures using human motion sequences and language can improve spoken discourse modeling in language models. To integrate gestures into language models, we first encode 3D human motion sequences into discrete gesture tokens using a VQ-VAE. These gesture token embeddings are then aligned with text embeddings through feature alignment, mapping them into the text embedding space. To evaluate the gesture-aligned language model on spoken discourse, we construct text infilling tasks targeting three key discourse cues grounded in linguistic research: discourse connectives, stance markers, and quantifiers. Results show that incorporating gestures enhances marker prediction accuracy across the three tasks, highlighting the complementary information that gestures can offer in modeling spoken discourse. We view this work as an initial step toward leveraging non-verbal cues to advance spoken language modeling in language models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03474v1

We employ current mainstream LLMs to perform word segmentation across multiple languages to assess LLMs' ""comprehension"".

To defend against such attacks, recent studies have developed various detection mechanisms. While significant efforts have focused on detecting direct prompt injection attacks, where injected instructions are directly from the attacker who is also the user, limited attention has been given to indirect prompt injection attacks, where injected instructions are indirectly from external tools, such as a search engine. Moreover, current works mainly investigate injection detection methods and pay less attention to the post-processing method that aims to mitigate the injection after detection. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of detecting and removing indirect prompt injection attacks, and we construct a benchmark dataset for evaluation. For detection, we assess the performance of existing LLMs and open-source detection models, and we further train detection models using our crafted training datasets. For removal, we evaluate two intuitive methods: (1) the segmentation removal method, which segments the injected document and removes parts containing injected instructions, and (2) the extraction removal method, which trains an extraction model to identify and remove injected instructions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16580v1

We provide a quantifiable measure of the distracting effect of a passage and demonstrate its robustness across LLMs. Our research introduces novel methods for identifying and using hard distracting passages to improve RAG systems. By fine-tuning LLMs with these carefully selected distracting passages, we achieve up to a 7.5% increase in answering accuracy compared to counterparts fine-tuned on conventional RAG datasets. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we move beyond the simple binary classification of irrelevant passages as either completely unrelated vs. distracting, and second, we develop and analyze multiple methods for finding hard distracting passages.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework for adapting multilingual encoders to text generation in extremely low-resource languages. By reusing the weights between the encoder and the decoder, our framework allows the model to leverage the learned semantic space of the encoder, enabling efficient learning and effective generalization in low-resource languages.

Graphically Speaking: Unmasking Abuse in Social Media with Conversation Insights,"['Célia Nouri', 'Chloé Clavel', 'Jean-Philippe Cointet']","Detecting abusive language in social media conversations poses significant challenges, as identifying abusiveness often depends on the conversational context, characterized by the content and topology of preceding comments.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to model social media conversations as graphs, where nodes represent comments, and edges capture reply structures. We systematically investigate various graph representations and context windows to identify the optimal configuration for ALD. Our GNN model outperform both context-agnostic baselines and linear context-aware methods, achieving significant improvements in F1 scores.

However, as LLMs continue to evolve, new vulnerabilities, especially prompt injection attacks arise. These attacks trick LLMs into deviating from the original input instructions and executing the attacker's instructions injected in data content, such as retrieved results. Recent attack methods leverage LLMs' instruction-following abilities and their inabilities to distinguish instructions injected in the data content, and achieve a high attack success rate (ASR). When comparing the attack and defense methods, we interestingly find that they share similar design goals, of inducing the model to ignore unwanted instructions and instead to execute wanted instructions. Therefore, we raise an intuitive question: Could these attack techniques be utilized for defensive purposes? In this paper, we invert the intention of prompt injection methods to develop novel defense methods based on previous training-free attack methods, by repeating the attack process but with the original input instruction rather than the injected instruction.

DNCASR uses two separate encoders to independently encode global speaker characteristics and local waveform information, along with two linked decoders to generate speaker-attributed transcriptions. The use of linked decoders allows the entire system to be jointly trained under a unified loss function. By employing a serialised training approach, DNCASR effectively addresses overlapping speech in real-world meetings, where the link improves the prediction of speaker indices in overlapping segments. Experiments on the AMI-MDM meeting corpus demonstrate that the jointly trained DNCASR outperforms a parallel system that does not have links between the speaker and ASR decoders.

Exploring Persona Sentiment Sensitivity in Personalized Dialogue Generation,"['Yonghyun Jun', 'Hwanhee Lee']","Personalized dialogue systems have advanced considerably with the integration of user-specific personas into large language models (LLMs). However, while LLMs can effectively generate personalized responses, the influence of persona sentiment on dialogue quality remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a large-scale analysis of dialogues generated using a range of polarized user profiles. Our experiments reveal that dialogues involving negatively polarized users tend to overemphasize persona attributes. In contrast, positively polarized profiles yield dialogues that selectively incorporate persona information, resulting in smoother interactions. Furthermore, we find that personas with weak or neutral sentiment generally produce lower-quality dialogues. Motivated by these findings, we propose a dialogue generation approach that explicitly accounts for persona polarity by combining a turn-based generation strategy with a profile ordering mechanism and sentiment-aware prompting. Our study provides new insights into the sensitivity of LLMs to persona sentiment and offers guidance for developing more robust and nuanced personalized dialogue systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11423v2

To address these issues, we in this paper propose AntiLeak-Bench, an automated anti-leakage benchmarking framework. Instead of simply using newly collected data, we construct samples with explicitly new knowledge absent from LLMs' training sets, which thus ensures strictly contamination-free evaluation. We further design a fully automated workflow to build and update our benchmark without human labor.

Hierarchical Bracketing Encodings for Dependency Parsing as Tagging,"['Ana Ezquerro', 'David Vilares', 'Anssi Yli-Jyrä', 'Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez']","We present a family of encodings for sequence labeling dependency parsing, based on the concept of hierarchical bracketing. We prove that the existing 4-bit projective encoding belongs to this family, but it is suboptimal in the number of labels used to encode a tree. We derive an optimal hierarchical bracketing, which minimizes the number of symbols used and encodes projective trees using only 12 distinct labels (vs. 16 for the 4-bit encoding). We also extend optimal hierarchical bracketing to support arbitrary non-projectivity in a more compact way than previous encodings. Our new encodings yield competitive accuracy on a diverse set of treebanks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11693v2
OASIS: Order-Augmented Strategy for Improved Code Search,"['GAO Zuchen', 'Zizheng Zhan', 'Xianming LI', 'Erxin Yu', 'Haotian Zhang', 'chenbin', 'Yuqun Zhang', 'Jing Li']","Code embeddings capture the semantic representations of code and are crucial for various code-related large language model (LLM) applications, such as code search. Previous training primarily relies on optimizing the InfoNCE loss by comparing positive natural language (NL)-code pairs with in-batch negatives. However, due to the sparse nature of code contexts, training solely by comparing the major differences between positive and negative pairs may fail to capture deeper semantic nuances. To address this issue, we propose a novel order-augmented strategy for improved code search (OASIS). It leverages order-based similarity labels to train models to capture subtle differences in similarity among negative pairs. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our OASIS model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models focusing solely on major positive-negative differences. It underscores the value of exploiting subtle differences among negative pairs with order labels for effective code embedding training.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08161v3
Can Large Language Models Detect Errors in Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning?,"['Yancheng He', 'Shilong Li', 'Jiaheng Liu', 'Weixun Wang', 'Xingyuan Bu', 'Ge Zhang', 'Z.Y.

In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models. Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19361v3

Dynamic Order Template Prediction for Generative Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"['Yonghyun Jun', 'Hwanhee Lee']","Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) assesses sentiments towards specific aspects within texts, resulting in detailed sentiment tuples. Previous ABSA models often use static templates to predict all of the elements in the tuples, and these models often fail to accurately capture dependencies between elements. Multi-view prompting method improves the performance of ABSA by predicting tuples with various templates and then ensembling the results. However, this method suffers from inefficiencies and out-of-distribution errors. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Order Template (DOT) method for ABSA, which dynamically generates necessary views for each instance based on instance-level entropy.

Existing studies have explored various diversity-aware data selection methods to construct high-quality datasets and enhance model performance. However, the fundamental problem of precisely defining and measuring data diversity remains underexplored, limiting clear guidance for data engineering. To address this, we systematically analyze 11 existing diversity measurement methods by evaluating their correlation with model performance through extensive fine-tuning experiments. Our results indicate that a reliable diversity measure should properly account for both inter-sample differences and the information density in the sample space. Building on this, we propose NovelSum, a new diversity metric based on sample-level ""novelty."" Experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that NovelSum accurately captures diversity variations and achieves a 0.97 correlation with instruction-tuned model performance, highlighting its value in guiding data engineering practices. With NovelSum as an optimization objective, we further develop a greedy, diversity-oriented data selection strategy that outperforms existing approaches, validating both the effectiveness and practical significance of our metric.

Micro-Act: Mitigate Knowledge Conflict in Question Answering via Actionable Self-Reasoning,"['Nan Huo', 'Jinyang Li', 'Bowen Qin', 'Ge Qu', 'Xiaolong Li', 'Xiaodong Li', 'Chenhao Ma', 'Reynold Cheng']","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent, parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its practical value in real-world RAG applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05278v1
Minimal Pair-Based Evaluation of Code-Switching,"['Igor Sterner', 'Simone Teufel']","There is a lack of an evaluation methodology that estimates the extent to which large language models (LLMs) use code-switching (CS) in the same way as bilinguals. Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01840v1

The AI Gap: How Socioeconomic Status Affects Language Technology Interactions,"['Elisa Bassignana', 'Amanda Cercas Curry', 'Dirk Hovy']","Socioeconomic status (SES) fundamentally influences how people interact with each other and more recently, with digital technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous research has highlighted the interaction between SES and language technology, it was limited by reliance on proxy metrics and synthetic data. We survey 1,000 individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds about their use of language technologies and generative AI, and collect 6,482 prompts from their previous interactions with LLMs. We find systematic differences across SES groups in language technology usage (i.e., frequency, performed tasks), interaction styles, and topics. Higher SES entails a higher level of abstraction, convey requests more concisely, and topics like 'inclusivity' and 'travel'. Lower SES correlates with higher anthropomorphization of LLMs (using ''hello'' and ''thank you'') and more concrete language. Our findings suggest that while generative language technologies are becoming more accessible to everyone, socioeconomic linguistic differences still stratify their use to exacerbate the digital divide. These differences underscore the importance of considering SES in developing language technologies to accommodate varying linguistic needs rooted in socioeconomic factors and limit the AI Gap across SES groups.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12158v2
Probing LLMs for Multilingual Discourse Generalization Through a Unified Label Set,"['Florian Eichin', 'Yang Janet Liu', 'Barbara Plank', 'Michael A.

This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) capture discourse knowledge that generalizes across languages and frameworks. We address this question along two dimensions: (1) developing a unified discourse relation label set to facilitate cross-lingual and cross-framework discourse analysis, and (2) probing LLMs to assess whether they encode generalizable discourse abstractions. Using multilingual discourse relation classification as a testbed, we examine a comprehensive set of 23 LLMs of varying sizes and multilingual capabilities. Our results show that LLMs, especially those with multilingual training corpora, can generalize discourse information across languages and frameworks. Further layer-wise analyses reveal that language generalization at the discourse level is most salient in the intermediate layers. Lastly, our error analysis provides an account of challenging relation classes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10515v2

To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an open-source initiative dedicated to developing high-quality, culturally relevant data for SEA languages. By involving contributors from SEA countries, SEA-VL aims to ensure better cultural relevance and diversity, fostering greater inclusivity of underrepresented languages in VL research. Beyond crowdsourcing, our initiative goes one step further in the exploration of the automatic collection of culturally relevant images through crawling and image generation. First, we find that image crawling achieves approximately ~85% cultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than crowdsourcing. Second, despite the substantial progress in generative vision models, synthetic images remain unreliable in accurately reflecting SEA cultures. The generated images often fail to reflect the nuanced traditions and cultural contexts of the region.

RoToR: Towards More Reliable Responses for Order-Invariant Inputs,"['Soyoung Yoon', 'Dongha Ahn', 'Youngwon Lee', 'Minkyu Jung', 'HyungJoo Jang', 'seung-won hwang']","Mitigating positional bias of language models (LMs) for listwise inputs is a well-known and important problem (e.g., lost-in-the-middle). While zero-shot order-invariant LMs have been proposed to solve this issue, their success on practical listwise problems has been limited. In this work, as a first contribution, we identify and overcome two limitations to make zero-shot invariant LMs more practical: (1) training and inference distribution mismatch arising from modifying positional ID assignments to enforce invariance, and (2) failure to adapt to mixture of order-invariant and sensitive inputs in practical listwise problems. Then, to overcome these issues we propose (1) RoToR, a zero-shot invariant LM for genuinely order-invariant inputs with minimal modifications of positional IDs, and (2) Selective Routing, an adaptive framework that handles both order-invariant and order-sensitive inputs in listwise tasks. On the Lost in the middle (LitM), Knowledge Graph QA (KGQA), and MMLU benchmarks, we show that RoToR with Selective Routing can effectively handle practical listwise input tasks in a zero-shot manner (https://github.com/soyoung97/RoToR)",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08662v3

These biases stem not only from differences in language but also from the cultural knowledge required to interpret questions, reducing the practical utility of translated datasets like MMLU. Furthermore, translation often introduces artefacts that can distort the meaning or clarity of questions in the target language. A common practice in multilingual evaluation is to rely on machine-translated evaluation sets, but simply translating a dataset is insufficient to address these challenges. In this work, we trace the impact of both of these issues on multilingual evaluations and ensuing model performances. Our large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art open and proprietary models illustrates that progress on MMLU depends heavily on learning Western-centric concepts, with 28% of all questions requiring culturally sensitive knowledge. Moreover, for questions requiring geographic knowledge, an astounding 84.9% focus on either North American or European regions. Rankings of model evaluations change depending on whether they are evaluated on the full portion or the subset of questions annotated as culturally sensitive, showing the distortion to model rankings when blindly relying on translated MMLU. We release Global MMLU, an improved MMLU with evaluation coverage across 42 languages -- with improved overall quality by engaging with compensated professional and community annotators to verify translation quality while also rigorously evaluating cultural biases present in the original dataset. This comprehensive Global MMLU set also includes designated subsets labeled as culturally sensitive and culturally agnostic to allow for more holistic, complete evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03304v2
Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification,"['Yaxin Fan', 'Peifeng Li', 'Qiaoming Zhu']","Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081v1

Previous delta-sparsification methods either remove parameters randomly or truncate singular vectors directly after singular value decomposition (SVD). However, these methods either disregard parameter importance entirely or evaluate it with too coarse a granularity. In this work, we introduce ImPart, a novel importance-aware delta sparsification approach. Leveraging SVD, it dynamically adjusts sparsity ratios of different singular vectors based on their importance, effectively retaining crucial task-specific knowledge even at high sparsity ratios. Experiments show that ImPart achieves state-of-the-art delta sparsification performance, demonstrating $2\times$ higher compression ratio than baselines at the same performance level.

A promising approach to mitigate this issue is enabling models to express uncertainty when unsure. Previous research on uncertainty modeling has primarily focused on short-form QA, but realworld applications often require much longer responses. In this work, we introduce the task of Long-form Generation with Uncertainty(LoGU). We identify two key challenges: Uncertainty Suppression, where models hesitate to express uncertainty, and Uncertainty Misalignment, where models convey uncertainty inaccurately. To tackle these challenges, we propose a refinement-based data collection framework and a two-stage training pipeline. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, refining uncertainty based on atomic claims. The collected data are then used in training through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance uncertainty expression.

KiRAG: Knowledge-Driven Iterative Retriever for Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"['Jinyuan Fang', 'Zaiqiao Meng', 'Craig MacDonald']","Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (iRAG) models offer an effective approach for multi-hop question answering (QA). However, their retrieval process faces two key challenges: (1) it can be disrupted by irrelevant documents or factually inaccurate chain-of-thoughts; (2) their retrievers are not designed to dynamically adapt to the evolving information needs in multi-step reasoning, making it difficult to identify and retrieve the missing information required at each iterative step. Therefore, we propose KiRAG, which uses a knowledge-driven iterative retriever model to enhance the retrieval process of iRAG. Specifically, KiRAG decomposes documents into knowledge triples and performs iterative retrieval with these triples to enable a factually reliable retrieval process. Moreover, KiRAG integrates reasoning into the retrieval process to dynamically identify and retrieve knowledge that bridges information gaps, effectively adapting to the evolving information needs. Empirical results show that KiRAG significantly outperforms existing iRAG models, with an average improvement of 9.40% in R@3 and 5.14% in F1 on multi-hop QA.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18397v1
Enhancing Lexicon-Based Text Embeddings with Large Language Models,"['Yibin Lei', 'Tao Shen', 'Yu Cao', 'Andrew Yates']","Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on general-purpose text embedding tasks.

Regarding the inherent tokenization redundancy issue and unidirectional attention limitations in traditional causal LLMs, LENS consolidates the vocabulary space through token embedding clustering, and investigates bidirectional attention and various pooling strategies. Specifically, LENS simplifies lexicon matching by assigning each dimension to a specific token cluster, where semantically similar tokens are grouped together, and unlocking the full potential of LLMs through bidirectional attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LENS outperforms dense embeddings on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), delivering compact feature representations that match the sizes of dense counterparts.

To address this, existing fine-tuning approaches operating at the data-level (e.g., through data augmentation or distillation) typically introduce implicit cross-lingual alignment, overlooking the potential for more profound, latent-level cross-lingual interactions. In this work, we propose CC-Tuning, a novel multilingual fine-tuning paradigm that explicitly establishes a cross-lingual connection mechanism at the latent level. During training, CC-Tuning fuses the feed forward activations from both English and non-English inputs, enabling the model to benefit from both linguistic resources. This process is facilitated with a trainable Decision Maker that identifies beneficial activations. Furthermore, during inference, a Transform Matrix is utilized to simulate the cross-lingual connection under monolingual setting through representation transformation. Our experiments on six benchmarks covering 22 languages show that CC-Tuning outperforms vanilla SFT and offers a strong latent-level alternative to data-level augmentation methods. Further analysis also highlights the practicality of CC-Tuning and the potential of latent-level cross-lingual interactions in advancing the multilingual performance of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00875v1
SConU: Selective Conformal Uncertainty in Large Language Models,"['Zhiyuan Wang', 'Qingni Wang', 'Yue Zhang', 'Tianlong Chen', 'Xiaofeng Zhu', 'Xiaoshuang Shi', 'Kaidi Xu']","As large language models are increasingly utilized in real-world applications, guarantees of task-specific metrics are essential for their reliable deployment. Previous studies have introduced various criteria of conformal uncertainty grounded in split conformal prediction, which offer user-specified correctness coverage. However, existing frameworks often fail to identify uncertainty data outliers that violate the exchangeability assumption, leading to unbounded miscoverage rates and unactionable prediction sets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach termed Selective Conformal Uncertainty (SConU), which, for the first time, implements significance tests, by developing two conformal p-values that are instrumental in determining whether a given sample deviates from the uncertainty distribution of the calibration set at a specific manageable risk level. Our approach not only facilitates rigorous management of miscoverage rates across both single-domain and interdisciplinary contexts, but also enhances the efficiency of predictions. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the components of the conformal procedures, aiming to approximate conditional coverage, particularly in high-stakes question-answering tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14154v2

When GPT Spills the Tea: Comprehensive Assessment of Knowledge File Leakage in GPTs,"['Xinyue Shen', 'Yun Shen', 'Michael Backes', 'Yang Zhang']","Knowledge files have been widely used in large language model (LLM) agents, such as GPTs, to improve response quality. However, concerns about the potential leakage of knowledge files have grown significantly. Existing studies demonstrate that adversarial prompts can induce GPTs to leak knowledge file content. Yet, it remains uncertain whether additional leakage vectors exist, particularly given the complex data flows across clients, servers, and databases in GPTs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive risk assessment of knowledge file leakage, leveraging a novel workflow inspired by Data Security Posture Management (DSPM). Through the analysis of 651,022 GPT metadata, 11,820 flows, and 1,466 responses, we identify five leakage vectors: metadata, GPT initialization, retrieval, sandboxed execution environments, and prompts. These vectors enable adversaries to extract sensitive knowledge file data such as titles, content, types, and sizes. Notably, the activation of the built-in tool Code Interpreter leads to a privilege escalation vulnerability, enabling adversaries to directly download original knowledge files with a 95.95% success rate. Further analysis reveals that 28.80% of leaked files are copyrighted, including digital copies from major publishers and internal materials from a listed company. In the end, we provide actionable solutions for GPT builders and platform providers to secure the GPT data supply chain.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00197v1
UniCodec: Unified Audio Codec with Single Domain-Adaptive Codebook,"['Yidi Jiang', 'Qian Chen', 'Shengpeng Ji', 'Yu Xi', 'Wen Wang', 'Chong Zhang', 'Xianghu Yue', 'ShiLiang Zhang', 'Haizhou Li']","The emergence of audio language models is empowered by neural audio codecs, which establish critical mappings between continuous waveforms and discrete tokens compatible with language model paradigms. The evolutionary trends from multi-layer residual vector quantizer to single-layer quantizer are beneficial for language-autoregressive decoding. However, the capability to handle multi-domain audio signals through a single codebook remains constrained by inter-domain distribution discrepancies. In this work, we introduce UniCodec, a unified audio codec with a single codebook to support multi-domain audio data, including speech, music, and sound. To achieve this, we propose a partitioned domain-adaptive codebook method and domain Mixture-of-Experts strategy to capture the distinct characteristics of each audio domain. Furthermore, to enrich the semantic density of the codec without auxiliary modules, we propose a self-supervised mask prediction modeling approach. Comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that UniCodec achieves excellent audio reconstruction performance across the three audio domains, outperforming existing unified neural codecs with a single codebook, and even surpasses state-of-the-art domain-specific codecs on both acoustic and semantic representation capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20067v1
KERL: Knowledge-Enhanced Personalized Recipe Recommendation using Large Language Models,"['Fnu Mohbat', 'Mohammed J Zaki']","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and the abundance of food data have resulted in studies to improve food understanding using LLMs. Despite several recommendation systems utilizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), there has been limited research on integrating food related KGs with LLMs. We introduce KERL, a unified system that leverages food KGs and LLMs to provide personalized food recommendations and generates recipes with associated micro-nutritional information. Given a natural language question, KERL extracts entities, retrieves subgraphs from the KG, which are then fed into the LLM as context to select the recipes that satisfy the constraints. Next, our system generates the cooking steps and nutritional information for each recipe. To evaluate our approach, we also develop a benchmark dataset by curating recipe related questions, combined with constraints and personal preferences. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed KG-augmented LLM significantly outperforms existing approaches, offering a complete and coherent solution for food recommendation, recipe generation, and nutritional analysis.

In this paper, we propose Controlled LoRA (CLoRA), a sub-space regularization method on LoRA structure. Aiming to reduce the scale of output change while introduce minimal constraint on model capacity, CLoRA imposes constraint on the direction of updating matrix's null space. Experimental results on one-stage LLM finetuning tasks and continual learning settings highlight the superority of CLoRA as a effective parameter efficient finetuning method with catastrophic forgetting mitigating.Further investigation for model parameters indicates that CLoRA effectively balances the trade-off between model capacity and degree of forgetting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16801v2

In this work, we formally define an emerging IR paradigm called \textit{Visualized Information Retrieval}, or \textbf{Vis-IR}, where multimodal information, such as texts, images, tables and charts, is jointly represented by a unified visual format called \textbf{Screenshots}, for various retrieval applications. We further make three key contributions for Vis-IR.

AgentRM: Enhancing Agent Generalization with Reward Modeling,"['Yu Xia', 'Jingru Fan', 'Weize Chen', 'Siyu Yan', 'Xin Cong', 'Zhong Zhang', 'Yaxi Lu', 'Yankai Lin', 'Zhiyuan Liu', 'Maosong Sun']","Existing LLM-based agents have achieved strong performance on held-in tasks, but their generalizability to unseen tasks remains poor. Hence, some recent work focus on fine-tuning the policy model with more diverse tasks to improve the generalizability. In this work, we find that finetuning a reward model to guide the policy model is more robust than directly finetuning the policy model. Based on this finding, we propose AgentRM, a generalizable reward model, to guide the policy model for effective test-time search. We comprehensively investigate three approaches to construct the reward model, including explicit reward modeling, implicit reward modeling and LLM-as-a-judge. We then use AgentRM to guide the answer generation with Best-of-N sampling and step-level beam search. On four types of nine agent tasks, AgentRM enhances the base policy model by $8.8$ points on average, surpassing the top general agent by $4.0$. Moreover, it demonstrates weak-to-strong generalization, yielding greater improvement of $12.6$ on LLaMA-3-70B policy model. As for the specializability, AgentRM can also boost a finetuned policy model and outperform the top specialized agent by $11.4$ on three held-in tasks. Further analysis verifies its effectiveness in test-time scaling. Codes will be released to facilitate the research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18407v1

Segment-Based Attention Masking for GPTs,"['Shahar Katz', 'Liran Ringel', 'Yaniv Romano', 'Lior Wolf']","Modern Language Models (LMs) owe much of their success to masked causal attention, the backbone of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models. Although GPTs can process the entire user prompt at once, the causal masking is applied to all input tokens step-by-step, mimicking the generation process. This imposes an unnecessary constraint during the initial ""prefill"" phase when the model processes the input prompt and generates the internal representations before producing any output tokens. In this work, attention is masked based on the known block structure at the prefill phase, followed by the conventional token-by-token autoregressive process after that. For example, in a typical chat prompt, the system prompt is treated as one block, and the user prompt as the next one. Each of these is treated as a unit for the purpose of masking, such that the first tokens in each block can access the subsequent tokens in a non-causal manner. Then, the model answer is generated in the conventional causal manner. This Segment-by-Segment scheme entails no additional computational overhead. When integrating it into models such as Llama and Qwen, state-of-the-art performance is consistently achieved.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18487v1
Cramming 1568 Tokens into a Single Vector and Back Again: Exploring the Limits of Embedding Space Capacity,"['Yuri Kuratov', 'Mikhail Arkhipov', 'Aydar Bulatov', 'Mikhail Burtsev']","A range of recent works addresses the problem of compression of sequence of tokens into a shorter sequence of real-valued vectors to be used as inputs instead of token embeddings or key-value cache. These approaches are focused on reduction of the amount of compute in existing language models rather than minimization of number of bits needed to store text. Despite relying on powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size. In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show that the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on this sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their practical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model design.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13063v3

Small language models (SLMs) offer a cost-effective alternative, but their limited capacity requires biomedical domain adaptation, which remains challenging. An additional bottleneck is the unavailability and high sensitivity of clinical data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for adapting SLMs into high-performing clinical models. We introduce the MediPhi collection of 3.8B-parameter SLMs developed with our novel framework: pre-instruction tuning of experts on relevant medical and clinical corpora (PMC, Medical Guideline, MedWiki, etc.), model merging, and clinical-tasks alignment. To cover most clinical tasks, we extended the CLUE benchmark to CLUE+, doubling its size. Our expert models deliver relative improvements on this benchmark over the base model without any task-specific fine-tuning: 64.3% on medical entities, 49.5% on radiology reports, and 44% on ICD-10 coding (outperforming GPT-4-0125 by 14%). We unify the expert models into MediPhi via model merging, preserving gains across benchmarks. Furthermore, we built the MediFlow collection, a synthetic dataset of 2.5 million high-quality instructions on 14 medical NLP tasks, 98 fine-grained document types, and JSON format support. Alignment of MediPhi using supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization achieves further gains of 18.9% on average.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10717v2
DIVE into MoE: Diversity-Enhanced Reconstruction of Large Language Models from Dense into Mixture-of-Experts,"['Yuchen Feng', 'Bowen Shen', 'Naibin Gu', 'Jiaxuan Zhao', 'Peng Fu', 'Zheng Lin', 'Weiping Wang']","Large language models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture achieve high cost-efficiency by selectively activating a subset of the parameters. Despite the inference efficiency of MoE LLMs, the training of extensive experts from scratch incurs substantial overhead, whereas reconstructing a dense LLM into an MoE LLM significantly reduces the training budget. However, existing reconstruction methods often overlook the diversity among experts, leading to potential redundancy. In this paper, we come up with the observation that a specific LLM exhibits notable diversity after being pruned on different calibration datasets, based on which we present a Diversity-Enhanced reconstruction method named DIVE. The recipe of DIVE includes domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction, and efficient retraining. Specifically, the reconstruction includes pruning and reassembly of the feed-forward network (FFN) module. After reconstruction, we efficiently retrain the model on routers, experts and normalization modules. We implement DIVE on Llama-style LLMs with open-source training corpora. Experiments show that DIVE achieves training efficiency with minimal accuracy trade-offs, outperforming existing pruning and MoE reconstruction methods with the same number of activated parameters.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09351v1

Computation Mechanism Behind LLM Position Generalization,"['Chi Han', 'Heng Ji']","Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences. Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13305v3
IPO: Your Language Model is Secretly a Preference Classifier,"['Shivank Garg', 'Ayush Singh', 'Shweta Singh', 'Paras Chopra']","Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the primary method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. While it enables LLMs to achieve human-level alignment, it often incurs significant computational and financial costs due to its reliance on training external reward models or human-labeled preferences. In this work, we propose Implicit Preference Optimization (IPO), an alternative approach that leverages generative LLMs as preference classifiers, thereby reducing the dependence on external human feedback or reward models to obtain preferences. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the preference classification ability of LLMs using RewardBench, assessing models across different sizes, architectures, and training levels to validate our hypothesis. Furthermore, we investigate the self-improvement capabilities of LLMs by generating multiple responses for a given instruction and employing the model itself as a preference classifier for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based training. Our findings demonstrate that models trained through IPO achieve performance comparable to those utilizing state-of-the-art reward models for obtaining preferences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16182v2

Existing methods to improve LLMs' logical capabilities either involve traceable or verifiable logical sequences that generate more reliable responses by constructing logical structures yet increase computational costs, or introduces rigid logic template rules, reducing flexibility. In this paper, we propose Reversal of Thought (RoT), a plug-and-play and cost-effective reasoning framework designed to enhance the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs during the warm-up phase prior to batch inference. RoT utilizes a Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning warm-up strategy, which integrates logical symbols for pseudocode planning through meta-cognitive mechanisms and pairwise preference self-evaluation to generate task-specific prompts solely through demonstrations, aligning with LLMs' cognitive preferences shaped by RLHF. Through reverse reasoning, we utilize a Cognitive Preference Manager to assess knowledge boundaries and further expand LLMs' reasoning capabilities by aggregating solution logic for known tasks and stylistic templates for unknown tasks. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate that RoT surpasses existing baselines in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12323v3

We introduce two variants of this task and address them with considerable success using both feature-based and neural models. We further introduce a general strategy for enhancing these models with machine generated simulations of eye movements from a cognitive model. Finally, we present an analysis of model performance which on the one hand yields insights on the information used by the models, and on the other hand leverages predictive modeling as an analytic tool for better characterization of the role of memory in repeated reading. Our work advances the understanding of the extent and manner in which eye movements in reading capture memory effects from prior text exposure, and paves the way for future applications that involve predictive modeling of repeated reading.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11061v1
LLMs can be easily Confused by Instructional Distractions,"['Yerin Hwang', 'Yongil Kim', 'Jahyun Koo', 'Taegwan Kang', 'Hyunkyung Bae', 'Kyomin Jung']","Despite the fact that large language models (LLMs) show exceptional skill in instruction following tasks, this strength can turn into a vulnerability when the models are required to disregard certain instructions. Instruction-following tasks typically involve a clear task description and input text containing the target data to be processed. However, when the input itself resembles an instruction, confusion may arise, even if there is explicit prompting to distinguish between the task instruction and the input. We refer to this phenomenon as instructional distraction. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark, named DIM-Bench, specifically designed to assess LLMs' performance under instructional distraction. The benchmark categorizes real-world instances of instructional distraction and evaluates LLMs across four instruction tasks: rewriting, proofreading, translation, and style transfer -- alongside five input tasks: reasoning, code generation, mathematical reasoning, bias detection, and question answering. Our experimental results reveal that even the most advanced LLMs are susceptible to instructional distraction, often failing to accurately follow user intent in such cases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04362v1

GRACE: A Granular Benchmark for Evaluating Model Calibration against Human Calibration,"['Yoo Yeon Sung', 'Eve Fleisig', 'Yu Hou', 'Ishan Upadhyay', 'Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber']","Language models are often miscalibrated, leading to confidently incorrect answers. We introduce GRACE, a benchmark for language model calibration that incorporates comparison with human calibration. GRACE consists of question-answer pairs, in which each question contains a series of clues that gradually become easier, all leading to the same answer; models must answer correctly as early as possible as the clues are revealed. This setting permits granular measurement of model calibration based on how early, accurately, and confidently a model answers. After collecting these questions, we host live human vs. model competitions to gather 1,749 data points on human and model teams' timing, accuracy, and confidence. We propose a metric, CalScore, that uses GRACE to analyze model calibration errors and identify types of model miscalibration that differ from human behavior. We find that although humans are less accurate than models, humans are generally better calibrated.

However, existing evaluations of test-time scaling make the strong assumption that a reasoning system should always give an answer to any question provided. This overlooks concerns about whether a model is confident in its answer, and whether it is appropriate to always provide a response. To address these concerns, we extract confidence scores during reasoning for thresholding model responses. We find that increasing compute budget at inference time not only helps models answer more questions correctly, but also increases confidence in correct responses. We then extend the current paradigm of zero-risk responses during evaluation by considering settings with non-zero levels of response risk, and suggest a recipe for reporting evaluations under these settings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13962v1

Through a detailed analysis of the optimization process, we introduce a novel conceptual framework to elucidate transferability and identify superfluous constraints-specifically, the response pattern constraint and the token tail constraint-as significant barriers to improved transferability. Removing these unnecessary constraints substantially enhances the transferability and controllability of gradient-based attacks. Evaluated on Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the source model, our method increases the overall Transfer Attack Success Rate (T-ASR) across a set of target models with varying safety levels from 18.4% to 50.3%, while also improving the stability and controllability of jailbreak behaviors on both source and target models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01865v1

The dataset is based on the prototypical task of automated claim verification, for which automated retrieval of real-world evidence is crucial. We compare DRUID to synthetic datasets (CounterFact, ConflictQA) and find that artificial datasets often fail to represent the complexity and diversity of realistically retrieved context. We show that synthetic datasets exaggerate context characteristics rare in real retrieved data, which leads to inflated context utilisation results, as measured by our novel ACU score. Moreover, while previous work has mainly focused on singleton context characteristics to explain context utilisation, correlations between singleton context properties and ACU on DRUID are surprisingly small compared to other properties related to context source. Overall, our work underscores the need for real-world aligned context utilisation studies to represent and improve performance in real-world RAG settings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17031v2

This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98\%. Contrary to expectations, larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions from multiple models. Although this approach both improves robustness and enhances alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with the best jury configurations. These results highlight the urgent need for diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety assessments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09347v3

AlignDistil: Token-Level Language Model Alignment as Adaptive Policy Distillation,"['Songming Zhang', 'Xue Zhang', 'Tong Zhang', 'Bojie Hu', 'Yufeng Chen', 'Jinan Xu']","In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02832v2

DARS: Dynamic Action Re-Sampling to Enhance Coding Agent Performance by Adaptive Tree Traversal,"['Vaibhav Aggarwal', 'Ojasv Kamal', 'Abhinav Japesh', 'Zhijing Jin', 'Bernhard Schölkopf']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, including natural language processing, data analysis, and software development, by enabling automation. In software engineering, LLM-powered coding agents have garnered significant attention due to their potential to automate complex development tasks, assist in debugging, and enhance productivity. However, existing approaches often struggle with sub-optimal decision-making, requiring either extensive manual intervention or inefficient compute scaling strategies. To improve coding agent performance, we present Dynamic Action Re-Sampling (DARS), a novel inference time compute scaling approach for coding agents, that is faster and more effective at recovering from sub-optimal decisions compared to baselines. While traditional agents either follow linear trajectories or rely on random sampling for scaling compute, our approach DARS works by branching out a trajectory at certain key decision points by taking an alternative action given the history of the trajectory and execution feedback of the previous attempt from that point. We evaluate our approach on SWE-Bench Lite benchmark, demonstrating that this scaling strategy achieves a pass@k score of 55% with Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2. Our framework achieves a pass@1 rate of 47%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14269v1
Steering off Course: Reliability Challenges in Steering Language Models,"['Patrick Queiroz Da Silva', 'Hari Sethuraman', 'Dheeraj Rajagopal', 'Hannaneh Hajishirzi', 'Sachin Kumar']","Steering methods for language models (LMs) have gained traction as lightweight alternatives to fine-tuning, enabling targeted modifications to model activations. However, prior studies primarily report results on a few models, leaving critical gaps in understanding the robustness of these methods. In this work, we systematically examine three prominent steering methods -- DoLa, function vectors, and task vectors. In contrast to the original studies, which evaluated a handful of models, we test up to 36 models belonging to 14 families with sizes ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters. Our experiments reveal substantial variability in the effectiveness of the steering approaches, with a large number of models showing no improvement and at times degradation in steering performance. Our analysis demonstrate fundamental flaws in the assumptions underlying these methods, challenging their reliability as scalable steering solutions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04635v1

If Eleanor Rigby Had Met ChatGPT: A Study on Loneliness in a Post-LLM World,['Adrian de Wynter'],"Warning: this paper discusses content related, but not limited to, violence, sex, and suicide. Loneliness, or the lack of fulfilling relationships, significantly impacts a person's mental and physical well-being and is prevalent worldwide. Previous research suggests that large language models (LLMs) may help mitigate loneliness. However, we argue that the use of widespread LLMs in services like ChatGPT is more prevalent--and riskier, as they are not designed for this purpose. To explore this, we analysed user interactions with ChatGPT outside of its marketed use as a task-oriented assistant. In dialogues classified as lonely, users frequently (37%) sought advice or validation, and received good engagement. However, ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios, like responding appropriately to suicidal ideation or trauma. We also observed a 35% higher incidence of toxic content, with women being 22x more likely to be targeted than men. Our findings underscore ethical and legal questions about this technology, and note risks like radicalisation or further isolation. We conclude with recommendations to research and industry to address loneliness.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01617v2

Vulnerability of LLMs to Vertically Aligned Text Manipulations,"['Zhecheng Li', 'Yiwei Wang', 'Bryan Hooi', 'Yujun Cai', 'Zhen Xiong', 'Nanyun Peng', 'Kai-Wei Chang']","Text classification involves categorizing a given text, such as determining its sentiment or identifying harmful content. With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), these models have become highly effective at performing text classification tasks. However, they still show vulnerabilities to variations in text formatting. Recent research demonstrates that modifying input formats, such as vertically aligning words for encoder-based models, can substantially lower accuracy in text classification tasks. While easily understood by humans, these inputs can significantly mislead models, posing a potential risk of bypassing detection in real-world scenarios involving harmful or sensitive information. With the expanding application of LLMs, a crucial question arises: Do decoder-based LLMs exhibit similar vulnerabilities to vertically formatted text input? In this paper, we investigate the impact of vertical text input on the performance of various LLMs across multiple text classification datasets and analyze the underlying causes. Our findings are as follows: (i) Vertical text input significantly degrades the accuracy of LLMs in text classification tasks. (ii) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning does not help LLMs recognize vertical input or mitigate its vulnerability, but few-shot learning with careful analysis does. (iii) We explore the underlying cause of the vulnerability by analyzing the inherent issues in tokenization and attention matrices.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20016v2
AutoMixer: Checkpoint Artifacts as Automatic Data Mixers,"['Ernie Chang', 'Yang Li', 'Patrick Huber', 'Vish Vogeti', 'David Kant', 'Yangyang Shi', 'Vikas Chandra']","In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory. Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data mixtures.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21910v1
Generalized Attention Flow: Feature Attribution for Transformer Models via Maximum Flow,"['Behrooz Azarkhalili', 'Maxwell W.

By extending Attention Flow and replacing attention weights with the generalized Information Tensor, GAF integrates attention weights, their gradients, the maximum flow problem, and the barrier method to enhance the performance of feature attributions. The proposed method exhibits key theoretical properties and mitigates the shortcomings of prior techniques that rely solely on simple aggregation of attention weights. Our comprehensive benchmarking on sequence classification tasks demonstrates that a specific variant of GAF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art feature attribution methods in most evaluation settings, providing a more reliable interpretation of Transformer model outputs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15765v1
Beyond Prompting: An Efficient Embedding Framework for Open-Domain Question Answering,"['Zhanghao Hu', 'Hanqi Yan', 'Qinglin Zhu', 'Zhenyi Shen', 'Yulan He', 'Lin Gui']","Large language models have recently pushed open domain question answering (ODQA) to new frontiers. However, prevailing retriever-reader pipelines often depend on multiple rounds of prompt level instructions, leading to high computational overhead, instability, and suboptimal retrieval coverage. In this paper, we propose EmbQA, an embedding-level framework that alleviates these shortcomings by enhancing both the retriever and the reader. Specifically, we refine query representations via lightweight linear layers under an unsupervised contrastive learning objective, thereby reordering retrieved passages to highlight those most likely to contain correct answers. Additionally, we introduce an exploratory embedding that broadens the model's latent semantic space to diversify candidate generation and employs an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most confident answer automatically. Extensive experiments across three open-source LLMs, three retrieval methods, and four ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that EmbQA substantially outperforms recent baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01606v2

However, current benchmarks, which are based on predefined domains and human-labeled data, face limitations in addressing evaluation needs for emerging domains both cost-effectively and efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose the Automated Heterogeneous Information Retrieval Benchmark (AIR-Bench). AIR-Bench is distinguished by three key features: 1) Automated. The testing data in AIR-Bench is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) without human intervention. 2) Heterogeneous. The testing data in AIR-Bench is generated with respect to diverse tasks, domains and languages. 3) Dynamic. The domains and languages covered by AIR-Bench are constantly augmented to provide an increasingly comprehensive evaluation benchmark for community developers. We develop a reliable and robust data generation pipeline to automatically create diverse and high-quality evaluation datasets based on real-world corpora.

Unveiling Cultural Blind Spots: Analyzing the Limitations of mLLMs in Procedural Text Comprehension,"['Amir Hossein Yari', 'Fajri Koto']","Despite the impressive performance of multilingual large language models (mLLMs) in various natural language processing tasks, their ability to understand procedural texts, particularly those with culture-specific content, remains largely unexplored. Texts describing cultural procedures, including rituals, traditional craftsmanship, and social etiquette, require an inherent understanding of cultural context, presenting a significant challenge for mLLMs. In this work, we introduce CAPTex, a benchmark designed to evaluate mLLMs' ability to process and reason about culturally diverse procedural texts across multiple languages using various methodologies to assess their performance. Our findings indicate that (1) mLLMs face difficulties with culturally contextualized procedural texts, showing notable performance declines in low-resource languages, (2) model performance fluctuates across cultural domains, with some areas presenting greater difficulties, and (3) language models exhibit better performance on multiple-choice tasks within conversational frameworks compared to direct questioning. These results underscore the current limitations of mLLMs in handling culturally nuanced procedural texts and highlight the need for culturally aware benchmarks like CAPTex to enhance their adaptability and comprehension across diverse linguistic and cultural landscapes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14315v1
Improving Language and Modality Transfer in Translation by Character-level Modeling,"['Ioannis Tsiamas', 'David Dale', 'Marta R. Costa-jussà']","Current translation systems, despite being highly multilingual, cover only 5% of the world's languages. Expanding language coverage to the long-tail of low-resource languages requires data-efficient methods that rely on cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge transfer. To this end, we propose a character-based approach to improve adaptability to new languages and modalities. Our method leverages SONAR, a multilingual fixed-size embedding space with different modules for encoding and decoding. We use a teacher-student approach with parallel translation data to obtain a character-level encoder. Then, using ASR data, we train a lightweight adapter to connect a massively multilingual CTC ASR model (MMS), to the character-level encoder, potentially enabling speech translation from 1,000+ languages. Experimental results in text translation for 75 languages on FLORES+ demonstrate that our character-based approach can achieve better language transfer than traditional subword-based models, especially outperforming them in low-resource settings, and demonstrating better zero-shot generalizability to unseen languages. Our speech adaptation, maximizing knowledge transfer from the text modality, achieves state-of-the-art results in speech-to-text translation on the FLEURS benchmark on 33 languages, surpassing previous supervised and cascade models, albeit being a zero-shot model with minimal supervision from ASR data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24561v1
DialUp! Modeling the Language Continuum by Adapting Models to Dialects and Dialects to Models,"['Niyati Bafna', 'Emily Chang', 'Nathaniel Romney Robinson', 'David R.

However, many of them have a closely-related high-resource language (HRL) neighbor, and differ in linguistically regular ways from it. This underscores the importance of model robustness to dialectal variation and cross-lingual generalization to the HRL dialect continuum. We present DialUp, consisting of a training-time technique for adapting a pretrained model to dialectal data (M->D), and an inference-time intervention adapting dialectal data to the model expertise (D->M). M->D induces model robustness to potentially unseen and unknown dialects by exposure to synthetic data exemplifying linguistic mechanisms of dialectal variation, whereas D->M treats dialectal divergence for known target dialects. These methods show considerable performance gains for several dialects from four language families, and modest gains for two other language families. We also conduct feature and error analyses, which show that language varieties with low baseline MT performance are more likely to benefit from these approaches.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16581v2
AutoMixAlign: Adaptive Data Mixing for Multi-Task Preference Optimization in LLMs,"['Nicholas E. Corrado', 'Julian Katz-Samuels', 'Adithya M Devraj', 'Hyokun Yun', 'Chao Zhang', 'Yi Xu', 'Yi Pan', 'Bing Yin', 'Trishul Chilimbi']","When aligning large language models (LLMs), their performance on various tasks (such as being helpful, harmless, and honest) depends heavily on the composition of their training data. However, selecting a data mixture that achieves strong performance across all tasks is challenging. Existing approaches rely on large ablation studies, heuristics, or human intuition, but these can be prohibitively expensive and suboptimal. We study this problem in the setting of preference optimization via DPO and introduce AutoMixAlign (AMA), a theoretically-grounded algorithm that adaptively mixes datasets during training to balance performance across tasks. AMA first trains \textit{specialist models} for each task to determine losses that correspond to strong task performance. Then, it trains a generalist model using a novel minimax optimization that prioritizes tasks for which generalist model losses deviate most from specialist model losses. To optimize this problem, we propose two algorithms: (1) AMA-R, which adaptively reweights the objective to prioritize tasks, and (2) AMA-S, which adaptively adjusts how much data is sampled from each task to prioritize tasks. Both algorithms achieve a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ in the convex case. AMA-R's convergence result follows from Sagawa et al. (2019), and we provide a convergence proof for AMA-S using online learning techniques such as EXP3. We evaluate AMA on several multitask alignment setups and find that AMA outperforms the standard alignment approach -- which simply optimizes the total loss across all tasks -- and also outperforms model merging methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00569v1

However, fine-tuning still remains essential to achieve satisfactory performance on downstream tasks, while the task-specific tuning samples are usually not readily available or expensive and time-consuming to obtain. To address this, we propose an error-driven data-efficient tuning framework that aims to efficiently adapt generic LMMs to newly emerging tasks without requiring any task-specific training samples. In our approach, a generic LMM, acting as a student model, is first evaluated on a small validation set of the target task, and then a more powerful model, acting as a teacher model, identifies the erroneous steps within the student model's reasoning steps and analyzes its capability gaps from fully addressing the target task. Based on these gaps, targeted training samples are further retrieved from existing task-agnostic datasets to tune the student model and tailor it to the target task. We perform extensive experiments across three different training data scales and seven tasks, demonstrating that our training paradigm significantly and efficiently improves LMM's performance on downstream tasks, achieving an average performance boost of 7.01%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15652v1
Planning with Diffusion Models for Target-Oriented Dialogue Systems,"['Hanwen Du', 'Bo Peng', 'Xia Ning']","Target-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) remains a significant challenge in the LLM era, where strategic dialogue planning is crucial for directing conversations toward specific targets. However, existing dialogue planning methods generate dialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from compounding errors and myopic actions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages diffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning. DiffTOD formulates dialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance, and leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the dialogue trajectory. To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD introduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types, offering flexible guidance towards diverse TOD targets at test time. Extensive experiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively perform non-myopic lookahead exploration and optimize action strategies over a long horizon through non-sequential dialogue planning, and demonstrates strong flexibility across complex and diverse dialogue scenarios.

Recent techniques have sought to structure LLM outputs using control flow and other code-adjacent techniques to improve planning performance. These techniques include using variables (to track important information) and functions (to divide complex tasks into smaller re-usable sub-tasks). However, purely code-based approaches can be error-prone and insufficient for handling ambiguous or unstructured data. To address these challenges, we propose REPL-Plan, an LLM planning approach that is fully code-expressive (it can utilize all the benefits of code) while also being dynamic (it can flexibly adapt from errors and use the LLM for fuzzy situations). In REPL-Plan, an LLM solves tasks by interacting with a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), which iteratively executes and evaluates code, similar to language shells or interactive code notebooks, allowing the model to flexibly correct errors and handle tasks dynamically. We demonstrate that REPL-Plan achieves strong results across various planning domains compared to previous methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13826v1

Fine-tuning large models for every niche application is often infeasible due to black-box constraints and high computational overhead. To address this, we propose a collaborative framework that pairs a specialized weak model with a general strong model. The weak model, tailored to specific domains, produces initial drafts and background information, while the strong model leverages its advanced reasoning to refine these drafts, extending LLMs' capabilities to critical yet specialized tasks. To optimize this collaboration, we introduce a collaborative feedback to fine-tunes the weak model, which quantifies the influence of the weak model's contributions in the collaboration procedure and establishes preference pairs to guide preference tuning of the weak model. We validate our framework through experiments on three domains. We find that the collaboration significantly outperforms each model alone by leveraging complementary strengths.

Understanding Silent Data Corruption in LLM Training,"['Jeffrey Jian Ma', 'Hengzhi Pei', 'Leonard Lausen', 'George Karypis']","As the scale of training large language models (LLMs) increases, one emergent failure is silent data corruption (SDC), where hardware produces incorrect computations without explicit failure signals. In this work, we are the first to investigate the impact of real-world SDCs on LLM training by comparing model training between healthy production nodes and unhealthy nodes exhibiting SDCs. With the help from a cloud computing platform, we access the unhealthy nodes that were swept out from production by automated fleet management. Using deterministic execution via XLA compiler and our proposed synchronization mechanisms, we isolate and analyze the impact of SDC errors on these nodes at three levels: at each submodule computation, at a single optimizer step, and at a training period. Our results reveal that the impact of SDCs on computation varies on different unhealthy nodes. Although in most cases the perturbations from SDCs on submodule computation and gradients are relatively small, SDCs can lead models to converge to different optima with different weights and even cause spikes in the training loss. Our analysis sheds light on further understanding and mitigating the impact of SDCs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12340v1

"Can LLMs Help Uncover Insights about LLMs? A Large-Scale, Evolving Literature Analysis of Frontier LLMs","['Jungsoo Park', 'Junmo Kang', 'Gabriel Stanovsky', 'Alan Ritter']","The surge of LLM studies makes synthesizing their findings challenging. Analysis of experimental results from literature can uncover important trends across studies, but the time-consuming nature of manual data extraction limits its use. Our study presents a semi-automated approach for literature analysis that accelerates data extraction using LLMs. It automatically identifies relevant arXiv papers, extracts experimental results and related attributes, and organizes them into a structured dataset, LLMEvalDB. We then conduct an automated literature analysis of frontier LLMs, reducing the effort of paper surveying and data extraction by more than 93% compared to manual approaches. We validate LLMEvalDB by showing that it reproduces key findings from a recent manual analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and also uncovers new insights that go beyond it, showing, for example, that in-context examples benefit coding & multimodal tasks but offer limited gains in math reasoning tasks compared to zero-shot CoT. Our automatically updatable dataset enables continuous tracking of target models by extracting evaluation studies as new data becomes available. Through LLMEvalDB and empirical analysis, we provide insights into LLMs while facilitating ongoing literature analyses of their behavior.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18791v3

To address these limitations, we introduce BIG5-CHAT, a large-scale dataset containing 100,000 dialogues designed to ground models in how humans express their personality in language. Leveraging this dataset, we explore Supervised Fine-Tuning and Direct Preference Optimization as training-based methods to align LLMs more naturally with human personality patterns. Our methods outperform prompting on personality assessments such as BFI and IPIP-NEO, with trait correlations more closely matching human data. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that models trained to exhibit higher conscientiousness, higher agreeableness, lower extraversion, and lower neuroticism display better performance on reasoning tasks, aligning with psychological findings on how these traits impact human cognitive performance.

Deep Temporal Reasoning in Video Language Models: A Cross-Linguistic Evaluation of Action Duration and Completion through Perfect Times,"['Olga Loginova', 'Sofía Ortega Loguinova']","Human perception of events is intrinsically tied to distinguishing between completed (perfect and telic) and ongoing (durative) actions, a process mediated by both linguistic structure and visual cues.

By pairing everyday activity videos with event completion labels and perfectivity-tailored distractors, our dataset probes whether models truly comprehend temporal dynamics or merely latch onto superficial markers. Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models, despite their success on text-based tasks, struggle to mirror human-like temporal and causal reasoning grounded in video. This study underscores the necessity of integrating deep multimodal cues to capture the nuances of action duration and completion within temporal and causal video dynamics, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing temporal reasoning in VLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00928v1

Partial Colexifications Improve Concept Embeddings,"['Arne Rubehn', 'Johann-Mattis List']","While the embedding of words has revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing, the embedding of concepts has received much less attention so far. A dense and meaningful representation of concepts, however, could prove useful for several tasks in computational linguistics, especially those involving cross-linguistic data or sparse data from low resource languages. First methods that have been proposed so far embed concepts from automatically constructed colexification networks. While these approaches depart from automatically inferred polysemies, attested across a larger number of languages, they are restricted to the word level, ignoring lexical relations that would only hold for parts of the words in a given language. Building on recently introduced methods for the inference of partial colexifications, we show how they can be used to improve concept embeddings in meaningful ways. The learned embeddings are evaluated against lexical similarity ratings, recorded instances of semantic shift, and word association data. We show that in all evaluation tasks, the inclusion of partial colexifications lead to improved concept representations and better results. Our results further show that the learned embeddings are able to capture and represent different semantic relationships between concepts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09743v1
Improved Unbiased Watermark for Large Language Models,"['Ruibo Chen', 'Yihan Wu', 'Junfeng Guo', 'Heng Huang']","As artificial intelligence surpasses human capabilities in text generation, the necessity to authenticate the origins of AI-generated content has become paramount. Unbiased watermarks offer a powerful solution by embedding statistical signals into language model-generated text without distorting the quality. In this paper, we introduce MCmark, a family of unbiased, Multi-Channel-based watermarks. MCmark works by partitioning the model's vocabulary into segments and promoting token probabilities within a selected segment based on a watermark key. We demonstrate that MCmark not only preserves the original distribution of the language model but also offers significant improvements in detectability and robustness over existing unbiased watermarks. Our experiments with widely-used language models demonstrate an improvement in detectability of over 10% using MCmark, compared to existing state-of-the-art unbiased watermarks. This advancement underscores MCmark's potential in enhancing the practical application of watermarking in AI-generated texts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11268v2
MaCP: Minimal yet Mighty Adaptation via Hierarchical Cosine Projection,"['Yixian Shen', 'Qi Bi', 'JIA-HONG HUANG', 'Hongyi Zhu', 'Andy D. Pimentel', 'Anuj Pathania']","We present a new adaptation method MaCP, Minimal yet Mighty adaptive Cosine Projection, that achieves exceptional performance while requiring minimal parameters and memory for fine-tuning large foundation models. Its general idea is to exploit the superior energy compaction and decorrelation properties of cosine projection to improve both model efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, it projects the weight change from the low-rank adaptation into the discrete cosine space. Then, the weight change is partitioned over different levels of the discrete cosine spectrum, and each partition's most critical frequency components are selected. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MaCP across a wide range of single-modality tasks, including natural language understanding, natural language generation, text summarization, as well as multi-modality tasks such as image classification and video understanding. MaCP consistently delivers superior accuracy, significantly reduced computational complexity, and lower memory requirements compared to existing alternatives.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23870v1
Multi-Attribute Steering of Language Models via Targeted Intervention,"['Duy Nguyen', 'Archiki Prasad', 'Elias Stengel-Eskin', 'Mohit Bansal']","Inference-time intervention (ITI) has emerged as a promising method for steering large language model (LLM) behavior in a particular direction (e.g., improving helpfulness) by intervening on token representations without costly updates to the LLM's parameters. However, existing ITI approaches fail to scale to multi-attribute settings with conflicts, such as enhancing helpfulness while also reducing toxicity. To address this, we introduce Multi-Attribute Targeted Steering (MAT-Steer), a novel steering framework designed for selective token-level intervention across multiple attributes. MAT-Steer learns steering vectors using an alignment objective that shifts the model's internal representations of undesirable outputs closer to those of desirable ones while enforcing sparsity and orthogonality among vectors for different attributes, thereby reducing inter-attribute conflicts. We evaluate MAT-Steer in two distinct settings: (i) on question answering (QA) tasks where we balance attributes like truthfulness, bias, and toxicity; (ii) on generative tasks where we simultaneously improve attributes like helpfulness, correctness, and coherence. MAT-Steer outperforms existing ITI and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches across both task types (e.g., 3% average accuracy gain across QA tasks and 55.82% win rate against the best ITI baseline).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12446v2
AdaptAgent: Adapting Multimodal Web Agents with Few-Shot Learning from Human Demonstrations,"['Gaurav Verma', 'Rachneet Kaur', 'Nishan Srishankar', 'Zhen Zeng', 'Tucker Balch', 'Manuela Veloso']","State-of-the-art multimodal web agents, powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), can autonomously execute many web tasks by processing user instructions and interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Current strategies for building web agents rely on (i) the generalizability of underlying MLLMs and their steerability via prompting, and (ii) large-scale fine-tuning of MLLMs on web-related tasks. However, web agents still struggle to automate tasks on unseen websites and domains, limiting their applicability to enterprise-specific and proprietary platforms. Beyond generalization from large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning, we propose building agents for few-shot adaptability using human demonstrations. We introduce the AdaptAgent framework that enables both proprietary and open-weights multimodal web agents to adapt to new websites and domains using few human demonstrations (up to 2). Our experiments on two popular benchmarks -- Mind2Web & VisualWebArena -- show that using in-context demonstrations (for proprietary models) or meta-adaptation demonstrations (for meta-learned open-weights models) boosts task success rate by 3.36% to 7.21% over non-adapted state-of-the-art models, corresponding to a relative increase of 21.03% to 65.75%. Furthermore, our additional analyses (a) show the effectiveness of multimodal demonstrations over text-only ones, (b) shed light on the influence of different data selection strategies during meta-learning on the generalization of the agent, and (c) demonstrate the effect of number of few-shot examples on the web agent's success rate. Overall, our results unlock a complementary axis for developing widely applicable multimodal web agents beyond large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning, emphasizing few-shot adaptability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13451v1
Can LLMs Identify Critical Limitations within Scientific Research? A Systematic Evaluation on AI Research Papers,"['Zhijian Xu', 'Yilun Zhao', 'Manasi Patwardhan', 'Lovekesh Vig', 'Arman Cohan']","Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations, remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers, enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02694v1
On the Acquisition of Shared Grammatical Representations in Bilingual Language Models,"['Catherine Arnett', 'Tyler A. Chang', 'James A. Michaelov', 'Ben Bergen']","Crosslingual transfer is crucial to contemporary language models' multilingual capabilities, but how it occurs is not well understood. We ask what happens to a monolingual language model when it begins to be trained on a second language. Specifically, we train small bilingual models for which we control the amount of data for each language and the order of language exposure. To find evidence of shared multilingual representations, we turn to structural priming, a method used to study grammatical representations in humans. We first replicate previous crosslingual structural priming results and find that after controlling for training data quantity and language exposure, there are asymmetrical effects across language pairs and directions. We argue that this asymmetry may shape hypotheses about human structural priming effects. We also find that structural priming effects are less robust for less similar language pairs, highlighting potential limitations of crosslingual transfer learning and shared representations for typologically diverse languages.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03962v2
GenKnowSub: Improving Modularity and Reusability of LLMs through General Knowledge Subtraction,"['Mohammadtaha Bagherifard', 'Sahar Rajabi', 'Ali Edalat', 'Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh']","Large language models often struggle with zero-shot generalization, and several modular approaches have been proposed to address this challenge. Yet, we hypothesize that a key limitation remains: the entanglement of general knowledge and task-specific adaptations. To overcome this, we propose a modular framework that disentangles these components by constructing a library of task-specific LoRA modules alongside a general-domain LoRA. By subtracting this general knowledge component from each task-specific module, we obtain residual modules that focus more exclusively on task-relevant information, a method we call general knowledge subtraction (GenKnowSub). Leveraging the refined task-specific modules and the Arrow routing algorithm \citep{ostapenko2024towards}, we dynamically select and combine modules for new inputs without additional training. Our studies on the Phi-3 model and standard Arrow as baselines reveal that using general knowledge LoRAs derived from diverse languages, including English, French, and German, yields consistent performance gains in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings across a wide set of benchmarks. Further experiments on Phi-2 demonstrate how GenKnowSub generalizes to weaker LLMs. The complete code and data are available at https://github.com/saharsamr/Modular-LLM.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10939v1
Using Shapley interactions to understand how models use structure,"['Diganta Misra', 'Divyansh Singhvi', 'Andrej Erkelens', 'Raghav Jain', 'Isabel Papadimitriou', 'Naomi Saphra']","Language is an intricately structured system, and a key goal of NLP interpretability is to provide methodological insights for understanding how language models represent this structure internally. In this paper, we use Shapley Taylor interaction indices (STII) in order to examine how language and speech models internally relate and structure their inputs. Pairwise Shapley interactions measure how much two inputs work together to influence model outputs beyond if we linearly added their independent influences, providing a view into how models encode structural interactions between inputs. We relate the interaction patterns in models to three underlying linguistic structures: syntactic structure, non-compositional semantics, and phonetic coarticulation. We find that autoregressive text models encode interactions that correlate with the syntactic proximity of inputs, and that both autoregressive and masked models encode nonlinear interactions in idiomatic phrases with non-compositional semantics. Our speech results show that inputs are more entangled for pairs where a neighboring consonant is likely to influence a vowel or approximant, showing that models encode the phonetic interaction needed for extracting discrete phonemic representations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13106v2
Adversarial Tokenization,"['Renato Geh', 'Zilei Shao', 'Guy Van den Broeck']","Current LLM pipelines account for only one possible tokenization for a given string, ignoring exponentially many alternative tokenizations during training and inference. For example, the standard Llama3 tokenization of penguin is [p,enguin], yet [peng,uin] is another perfectly valid alternative. In this paper, we show that despite LLMs being trained solely on one tokenization, they still retain semantic understanding of other tokenizations, raising questions about their implications in LLM safety. Put succinctly, we answer the following question: can we adversarially tokenize an obviously malicious string to evade safety and alignment restrictions? We show that not only is adversarial tokenization an effective yet previously neglected axis of attack, but it is also competitive against existing state-of-the-art adversarial approaches without changing the text of the harmful request. We empirically validate this exploit across three state-of-the-art LLMs and adversarial datasets, revealing a previously unknown vulnerability in subword models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02174v2
Classifying Unreliable Narrators with Large Language Models,"['Anneliese Brei', 'Katharine Henry', 'Abhisheik Sharma', 'Shashank Srivastava', 'Snigdha Chaturvedi']","Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators.

ConceptCarve: Dynamic Realization of Evidence,"['Eylon Caplan', 'Dan Goldwasser']","Finding evidence for human opinion and behavior at scale is a challenging task, often requiring an understanding of sophisticated thought patterns among vast online communities found on social media. For example, studying how gun ownership is related to the perception of Freedom, requires a retrieval system that can operate at scale over social media posts, while dealing with two key challenges: (1) identifying abstract concept instances, (2) which can be instantiated differently across different communities. To address these, we introduce ConceptCarve, an evidence retrieval framework that utilizes traditional retrievers and LLMs to dynamically characterize the search space during retrieval. Our experiments show that ConceptCarve surpasses traditional retrieval systems in finding evidence within a social media community. It also produces an interpretable representation of the evidence for that community, which we use to qualitatively analyze complex thought patterns that manifest differently across the communities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07228v2
QQSUM: A Novel Task and Model of Quantitative Query-Focused Summarization for Review-based Product Question Answering,"['An Quang Tang', 'Xiuzhen Zhang', 'Minh Ngoc Dinh', 'Zhuang Li']","Review-based Product Question Answering (PQA) allows e-commerce platforms to automatically address customer queries by leveraging insights from user reviews. However, existing PQA systems generate answers with only a single perspective, failing to capture the diversity of customer opinions. In this paper we introduce a novel task Quantitative Query-Focused Summarization (QQSUM), which aims to summarize diverse customer opinions into representative Key Points (KPs) and quantify their prevalence to effectively answer user queries. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows promise for PQA, its generated answers still fall short of capturing the full diversity of viewpoints. To tackle this challenge, our model QQSUM-RAG, which extends RAG, employs few-shot learning to jointly train a KP-oriented retriever and a KP summary generator, enabling KP-based summaries that capture diverse and representative opinions. Experimental results demonstrate that QQSUM-RAG achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art RAG baselines in both textual quality and quantification accuracy of opinions.

Navigating Rifts in Human-LLM Grounding: Study and Benchmark,"['Omar Shaikh', 'Hussein Mozannar', 'Gagan Bansal', 'Adam Fourney', 'Eric Horvitz']","Language models excel at following instructions but often struggle with the collaborative aspects of conversation that humans naturally employ. This limitation in grounding -- the process by which conversation participants establish mutual understanding -- can lead to outcomes ranging from frustrated users to serious consequences in high-stakes scenarios. To systematically study grounding challenges in human-LLM interactions, we analyze logs from three human-assistant datasets: WildChat, MultiWOZ, and Bing Chat. We develop a taxonomy of grounding acts and build models to annotate and forecast grounding behavior. Our findings reveal significant differences in human-human and human-LLM grounding: LLMs were three times less likely to initiate clarification and sixteen times less likely to provide follow-up requests than humans. Additionally, we find that early grounding failures predict later interaction breakdowns. Building on these insights, we introduce Rifts, a benchmark derived from publicly available LLM interaction data containing situations where LLMs fail to initiate grounding. We note that current frontier models perform poorly on Rifts, highlighting the need to reconsider how we train and prompt LLMs for human interaction. To this end, we develop a preliminary intervention aimed at mitigating grounding failures.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13975v2
Substance over Style: Evaluating Proactive Conversational Coaching Agents,"['Vidya Srinivas', 'Xuhai Xu', 'Xin Liu', 'Kumar Ayush', 'Isaac Galatzer-Levy', 'Shwetak Patel', 'Daniel McDuff', 'Tim Althoff']","While NLP research has made strides in conversational tasks, many approaches focus on single-turn responses with well-defined objectives or evaluation criteria. In contrast, coaching presents unique challenges with initially undefined goals that evolve through multi-turn interactions, subjective evaluation criteria, mixed-initiative dialogue. In this work, we describe and implement five multi-turn coaching agents that exhibit distinct conversational styles, and evaluate them through a user study, collecting first-person feedback on 155 conversations. We find that users highly value core functionality, and that stylistic components in absence of core components are viewed negatively. By comparing user feedback with third-person evaluations from health experts and an LM, we reveal significant misalignment across evaluation approaches. Our findings provide insights into design and evaluation of conversational coaching agents and contribute toward improving human-centered NLP applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19328v2

While recent studies focus on generating semantic and stylistic variations of given design concepts, functional coherence--the integration of multiple affordances into a single coherent concept--remains largely overlooked. In this paper, we introduce SYNTHIA, a framework for generating novel, functionally coherent designs based on desired affordances. Our approach leverages a hierarchical concept ontology that decomposes concepts into parts and affordances, serving as a crucial building block for functionally coherent design. We also develop a curriculum learning scheme based on our ontology that contrastively fine-tunes T2I models to progressively learn affordance composition while maintaining visual novelty. To elaborate, we (i) gradually increase affordance distance, guiding models from basic concept-affordance association to complex affordance compositions that integrate parts of distinct affordances into a single, coherent form, and (ii) enforce visual novelty by employing contrastive objectives to push learned representations away from existing concepts. Experimental results show that SYNTHIA outperforms state-of-the-art T2I models, demonstrating absolute gains of 25.1% and 14.7% for novelty and functional coherence in human evaluation, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17793v3

In these tasks, the challenge is to ensure that the client's actions (i.e., interactions with the counselor) are consistent with with its stipulated profiles and negative behavior settings. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that supports consistent client simulation for mental health counseling. Our framework tracks the mental state of a simulated client, controls its state transitions, and generates for each state behaviors consistent with the client's motivation, beliefs, preferred plan to change, and receptivity. By varying the client profile and receptivity, we demonstrate that consistent simulated clients for different counseling scenarios can be effectively created.

Structural Reasoning Improves Molecular Understanding of LLM,"['Yunhui Jang', 'Jaehyung Kim', 'Sungsoo Ahn']","Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress, approaching human perception levels. In this work, we demonstrate that despite these advances, LLMs still struggle to reason using molecular structural information. This gap is critical because many molecular properties, including functional groups, depend heavily on such structural details. To address this limitation, we propose an approach that sketches molecular structures for reasoning. Specifically, we introduce Molecular Structural Reasoning (MSR) framework to enhance the understanding of LLMs by explicitly incorporating the key structural features. We present two frameworks for scenarios where the target molecule is known or unknown.

These components work together to evoke change talk, aligning with MI principles and improving counseling outcomes for clients from diverse backgrounds. We evaluate CAMI's performance through both automated and manual evaluations, utilizing simulated clients to assess MI skill competency, client's state inference accuracy, topic exploration proficiency, and overall counseling success.

Know You First and Be You Better: Modeling Human-Like User Simulators via Implicit Profiles,"['Kuang Wang', 'Xianfei Li', 'Shenghao Yang', 'Li Zhou', 'Feng Jiang', 'Haizhou Li']","User simulators are crucial for replicating human interactions with dialogue systems, supporting both collaborative training and automatic evaluation, especially for large language models (LLMs). However, current role-playing methods face challenges such as a lack of utterance-level authenticity and user-level diversity, often hindered by role confusion and dependence on predefined profiles of well-known figures. In contrast, direct simulation focuses solely on text, neglecting implicit user traits like personality and conversation-level consistency. To address these issues, we introduce the User Simulator with Implicit Profiles (USP), a framework that infers implicit user profiles from human-machine interactions to simulate personalized and realistic dialogues. We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a comprehensive profile schema, then refine the simulation using conditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle consistency, optimizing at both the utterance and conversation levels. Finally, a diverse profile sampler captures the distribution of real-world user profiles. Experimental results show that USP outperforms strong baselines in terms of authenticity and diversity while maintaining comparable consistency.

Prior methods steer LLMs via descriptions of subpopulations as LLMs' input prompt, yet such prompt engineering approaches have struggled to faithfully predict the distribution of survey responses from human subjects. In this work, we propose directly fine-tuning LLMs to predict response distributions by leveraging unique structural characteristics of survey data. To enable fine-tuning, we curate SubPOP, a significantly scaled dataset of 3,362 questions and 70K subpopulation-response pairs from well-established public opinion surveys. We show that fine-tuning on SubPOP greatly improves the match between LLM predictions and human responses across various subpopulations, reducing the LLM-human gap by up to 46% compared to baselines, and achieves strong generalization to unseen surveys and subpopulations.

By augmenting Text-to-SQL datasets with synthetic CoT solutions, we achieve, for the first time, consistent and significant performance improvements using DPO. Our analysis shows that CoT reasoning is crucial for unlocking DPO's potential, as it mitigates reward hacking, strengthens discriminative capabilities, and improves scalability.

On Generalization across Measurement Systems: LLMs Entail More Test-Time Compute for Underrepresented Cultures,"['Minh Duc Bui', 'Kyung eun Park', 'Goran Glavaš', 'Fabian David Schmidt', 'Katharina von der Wense']","Measurement systems (e.g., currencies) differ across cultures, but the conversions between them are well defined so that humans can state facts using any measurement system of their choice. Being available to users from diverse cultural backgrounds, large language models (LLMs) should also be able to provide accurate information irrespective of the measurement system at hand. Using newly compiled datasets we test if this is the case for seven open-source LLMs, addressing three key research questions: (RQ1) What is the default system used by LLMs for each type of measurement? (RQ2) Do LLMs' answers and their accuracy vary across different measurement systems? (RQ3) Can LLMs mitigate potential challenges w.r.t. underrepresented systems via reasoning? Our findings show that LLMs default to the measurement system predominantly used in the data. Additionally, we observe considerable instability and variance in performance across different measurement systems. While this instability can in part be mitigated by employing reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought (CoT), this implies longer responses and thereby significantly increases test-time compute (and inference costs), marginalizing users from cultural backgrounds that use underrepresented measurement systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02591v1

Our benchmark, CORDIAL, encompasses a broad spectrum of Coherence Relations across 3 different discourse domains at varying levels of granularity. Through our experiments on 10+ MLLMs employing different prompting strategies, we show that even top models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o fail to match the performance of simple classifier-based baselines.

To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport-based token weighting scheme for enhancing direct \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (OTPO). By emphasizing semantically meaningful token pairs and de-emphasizing less relevant ones, our method introduces a context-aware token weighting scheme that yields a more contrastive reward difference estimate. This adaptive weighting enhances reward stability, improves interpretability, and ensures that preference optimization focuses on meaningful differences between responses.

However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and provide valuable insights for future research. The demonstration of our benchmark is available at https://tsg-bench.netlify.app. Additionally, our code and evaluation data are publicly available at https://github.com/docworlds/tsg-bench.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19510v2
Beyond Frameworks: Unpacking Collaboration Strategies in Multi-Agent Systems,"['Haochun Wang', 'Sendong Zhao', 'Jingbo Wang', 'Zewen Qiang', 'Bing Qin', 'Ting Liu']","Multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for addressing complex, distributed tasks in large language model (LLM)-driven applications. While prior research has focused on high-level architectural frameworks, the granular mechanisms governing agents, critical to performance and scalability, remain underexplored. This study systematically investigates four dimensions of collaboration strategies: (1) agent governance, (2) participation control, (3) interaction dynamics, and (4) dialogue history management. Through rigorous experimentation under two context-dependent scenarios: Distributed Evidence Integration (DEI) and Structured Evidence Synthesis (SES), we quantify the impact of these strategies on both task accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings reveal that centralized governance, instructor-led participation, ordered interaction patterns, and instructor-curated context summarization collectively optimize the trade-off between decision quality and resource utilization with the support of the proposed Token-Accuracy Ratio (TAR). This work establishes a foundation for designing adaptive, scalable multi-agent systems, shifting the focus from structural novelty to strategic interaction mechanics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12467v1
The Invisible Hand: Unveiling Provider Bias in Large Language Models for Code Generation,"['Xiaoyu Zhang', 'Juan Zhai', 'Shiqing Ma', 'Qingshuang Bao', 'Weipeng Jiang', 'Qian Wang', 'Chao Shen', 'Yang Liu']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as the new recommendation engines, surpassing traditional methods in both capability and scope, particularly in code generation. In this paper, we reveal a novel provider bias in LLMs: without explicit directives, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure). To systematically investigate this bias, we develop an automated pipeline to construct the dataset, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation across seven state-of-the-art LLMs, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to $5,000+ in computational costs). Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers without users' requests. Such a bias holds far-reaching implications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially contributing to digital monopolies. It may also deceive users and violate their expectations, leading to various consequences. We call on the academic community to recognize this emerging issue and develop effective evaluation and mitigation methods to uphold AI security and fairness.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07849v3
K/DA: Automated Data Generation Pipeline for Detoxifying Implicitly Offensive Language in Korean,"['Minkyeong Jeon', 'Hyemin Jeong', 'Yerang Kim', 'Jiyoung Kim', 'Jae Hyeon Cho', 'Byung-Jun Lee']","Language detoxification involves removing toxicity from offensive language. While a neutral-toxic paired dataset provides a straightforward approach for training detoxification models, creating such datasets presents several challenges: i) the need for human annotation to build paired data, and ii) the rapid evolution of offensive terms, rendering static datasets quickly outdated. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an automated paired data generation pipeline, called K/DA. This pipeline is designed to generate offensive language with implicit offensiveness and trend-aligned slang, making the resulting dataset suitable for detoxification model training. We demonstrate that the dataset generated by K/DA exhibits high pair consistency and greater implicit offensiveness compared to existing Korean datasets, and also demonstrates applicability to other languages. Furthermore, it enables effective training of a high-performing detoxification model with simple instruction fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13513v1
THOR-MoE: Hierarchical Task-Guided and Context-Responsive Routing for Neural Machine Translation,"['Yunlong Liang', 'Fandong Meng', 'Jie Zhou']","The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has achieved significant progress for neural machine translation (NMT). However, there exist two limitations in current MoE solutions which may lead to sub-optimal performance: 1) they directly use the task knowledge of NMT into MoE (\emph{e.g.}, domain/linguistics-specific knowledge), which are generally unavailable at practical application and neglect the naturally grouped domain/linguistic properties; 2) the expert selection only depends on the localized token representation without considering the context, which fully grasps the state of each token in a global view. To address the above limitations, we propose THOR-MoE via arming the MoE with hierarchical task-guided and context-responsive routing policies. Specifically, it 1) firstly predicts the domain/language label and then extracts mixed domain/language representation to allocate task-level experts in a hierarchical manner; 2) injects the context information to enhance the token routing from the pre-selected task-level experts set, which can help each token to be accurately routed to more specialized and suitable experts. Extensive experiments on multi-domain translation and multilingual translation benchmarks with different architectures consistently demonstrate the superior performance of THOR-MoE. Additionally, the THOR-MoE operates as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing Top-$k$~\cite{shazeer2017} and Top-$p$~\cite{huang-etal-2024-harder} routing schemes, ensuring broad applicability across diverse MoE architectures. For instance, compared with vanilla Top-$p$~\cite{huang-etal-2024-harder} routing, the context-aware manner can achieve an average improvement of 0.75 BLEU with less than 22\% activated parameters on multi-domain translation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14173v1

Viewing the output speech as a data distribution, previous approaches often employ traditional speech representations, such as waveforms or spectrograms, within the Flow Matching framework. However, these methods have limitations, including overlooking various speech attributes and incurring high computational costs due to additional constraints introduced during training. To address these challenges, we introduce OZSpeech, the first TTS method to explore optimal transport conditional flow matching with one-step sampling and a learned prior as the condition, effectively disregarding preceding states and reducing the number of sampling steps. Our approach operates on disentangled, factorized components of speech in token format, enabling accurate modeling of each speech attribute, which enhances the TTS system's ability to precisely clone the prompt speech. Experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance over existing methods in content accuracy, naturalness, prosody generation, and speaker style preservation.

Existing approaches either solely optimize action selection or leverage world models during inference, overlooking the benefits of learning to model the world as a way to enhance planning capabilities. We propose Dual Preference Optimization (D$^2$PO), a new learning framework that jointly optimizes state prediction and action selection through preference learning, enabling LVLMs to understand environment dynamics for better planning. To automatically collect trajectories and stepwise preference data without human annotation, we introduce a tree search mechanism for extensive exploration via trial-and-error. Extensive experiments on VoTa-Bench demonstrate that our D$^2$PO-based method significantly outperforms existing methods and GPT-4o when applied to Qwen2-VL (7B), LLaVA-1.6 (7B), and LLaMA-3.2 (11B), achieving superior task success rates with more efficient execution paths.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10480v1

While researchers have proposed different jailbreak attacks in depth, they have done so in isolation -- either with unaligned settings or comparing a limited range of methods. To fill this gap, we present a large-scale evaluation of various jailbreak attacks. We collect 17 representative jailbreak attacks, summarize their features, and establish a novel jailbreak attack taxonomy. Then we conduct comprehensive measurement and ablation studies across nine aligned LLMs on 160 forbidden questions from 16 violation categories. Also, we test jailbreak attacks under eight advanced defenses. Based on our taxonomy and experiments, we identify some important patterns, such as heuristic-based attacks could achieve high attack success rates but are easy to mitigate by defenses, causing low practicality. Our study offers valuable insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and defenses.

CogniBench: A Legal-inspired Framework and Dataset for Assessing Cognitive Faithfulness of Large Language Models,"['Xiaqiang Tang', 'Jian Li', 'Keyu Hu', 'nan du', 'Xiaolong Li', 'Xi Zhang', 'Weigao Sun', 'Sihong Xie']","Faithfulness hallucinations are claims generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) not supported by contexts provided to the LLM. Lacking assessment standards, existing benchmarks focus on ""factual statements"" that rephrase source materials while overlooking ""cognitive statements"" that involve making inferences from the given context. Consequently, evaluating and detecting the hallucination of cognitive statements remains challenging. Inspired by how evidence is assessed in the legal domain, we design a rigorous framework to assess different levels of faithfulness of cognitive statements and introduce the CogniBench dataset where we reveal insightful statistics. To keep pace with rapidly evolving LLMs, we further develop an automatic annotation pipeline that scales easily across different models. This results in a large-scale CogniBench-L dataset, which facilitates training accurate detectors for both factual and cognitive hallucinations.

Neural Incompatibility: The Unbridgeable Gap of Cross-Scale Parametric Knowledge Transfer in Large Language Models,"['Yuqiao Tan', 'Shizhu He', 'Kang Liu', 'Jun Zhao']","Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transparent brain with accessible parameters that encode extensive knowledge, which can be analyzed, located and transferred. Consequently, a key research challenge is to transcend traditional knowledge transfer paradigms rooted in symbolic language and achieve genuine Parametric Knowledge Transfer (PKT). Significantly, exploring effective methods for transferring knowledge across LLMs of different scales through parameters presents an intriguing and valuable research direction. In this paper, we first demonstrate $\textbf{Alignment}$ in parametric space is the fundamental prerequisite to achieve successful cross-scale PKT. We redefine the previously explored knowledge transfer as Post-Align PKT (PostPKT), which utilizes extracted parameters for LoRA initialization and requires subsequent fine-tune for alignment. Hence, to reduce cost for further fine-tuning, we introduce a novel Pre-Align PKT (PrePKT) paradigm and propose a solution called $\textbf{LaTen}$ ($\textbf{L}$oc$\textbf{a}$te-$\textbf{T}$h$\textbf{e}$n-Alig$\textbf{n}$) that aligns the parametric spaces of LLMs across scales only using several training steps without following training. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that both PostPKT and PrePKT face challenges in achieving consistently stable transfer. Through in-depth analysis, we identify $\textbf{Neural Incompatibility}$ as the ethological and parametric structural differences between LLMs of varying scales, presenting fundamental challenges to achieving effective PKT. These findings provide fresh insights into the parametric architectures of LLMs and highlight promising directions for future research on efficient PKT.

Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs by Stepwise Correction,"['Zhenyu Wu', 'Qingkai Zeng', 'Zhihan Zhang', 'Zhaoxuan Tan', 'Chao Shen', 'Meng Jiang']","Best-of-N decoding methods instruct large language models (LLMs) to generate multiple solutions, score each using a scoring function, and select the highest scored as the final answer to mathematical reasoning problems. However, this repeated independent process often leads to the same mistakes, making the selected solution still incorrect. We propose a novel prompting method named Stepwise Correction (StepCo) that helps LLMs identify and revise incorrect steps in their generated reasoning paths. It iterates verification and revision phases that employ a process-supervised verifier. The verify-then-revise process not only improves answer correctness but also reduces token consumption with fewer paths needed to generate. With StepCo, a series of LLMs demonstrate exceptional performance. Notably, using GPT-4o as the backend LLM, StepCo achieves an average accuracy of 94.1 across eight datasets, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art Best-of-N method by +2.4, while reducing token consumption by 77.8%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12934v1

To address this issue, we introduce a model-agnostic two-stage Consistency Reflection and Correction (CRC) framework. Specifically, in the consistency reflection stage, the model is prompted to reflect on the discrepancies between generated responses and dialogue contexts, identifying inconsistencies and suggesting possible corrections. In the consistency correction stage, the model generates responses that are more consistent with the dialogue context based on these reflection results. We conducted experiments on various model architectures with different parameter sizes, including encoder-decoder models (BART, T5) and decoder-only models (GPT-2, DialoGPT, Phi3, Mistral and LLaMA3), and the experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our CRC framework significantly improves the consistency between generated responses and dialogue contexts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13366v3

Although MNMT-specific models trained on parallel data offer low costs in training and deployment, their performance consistently lags behind that of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce registering, a novel method that enables a small MNMT-specific model to compete with LLMs. Specifically, we insert a set of artificial tokens specifying the target language, called registers, into the input sequence between the source and target tokens. By modifying the attention mask, the target token generation only pays attention to the activation of registers, representing the source tokens in the target language space. Experiments on EC-40, a large-scale benchmark, show that our method advances the state-of-the-art of MNMT.

Dolphin first generates novel ideas based on feedback from previous experiments and relevant papers ranked by the topic and task attributes. Then, the generated ideas can be implemented using a code template refined and debugged with the designed exception-traceback-guided local code structure. Finally, Dolphin automatically analyzes the results of each idea and feeds the results back to the next round of idea generation.

Prompt-Guided Internal States for Hallucination Detection of Large Language Models,"['Fujie Zhang', 'Peiqi Yu', 'Biao Yi', 'Baolei Zhang', 'Tong Li', 'Zheli Liu']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks in different domains. However, they sometimes generate responses that are logically coherent but factually incorrect or misleading, which is known as LLM hallucinations. Data-driven supervised methods train hallucination detectors by leveraging the internal states of LLMs, but detectors trained on specific domains often struggle to generalize well to other domains. In this paper, we aim to enhance the cross-domain performance of supervised detectors with only in-domain data. We propose a novel framework, prompt-guided internal states for hallucination detection of LLMs, namely PRISM. By utilizing appropriate prompts to guide changes to the structure related to text truthfulness in LLMs' internal states, we make this structure more salient and consistent across texts from different domains.

However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it with the LLM`s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which undermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling discrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context. Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and integrate conflicting facts before generating responses.

Existing literature primarily concentrates on binary, document-level detection, thereby neglecting texts that are composed jointly by human and LLM contributions. Hence, this paper explores the possibility of fine-grained MGT detection under human-AI coauthoring. We suggest fine-grained detectors can pave pathways toward coauthored text detection with a numeric AI ratio. Specifically, we propose a dataset, HACo-Det, which produces human-AI coauthored texts via an automatic pipeline with word-level attribution labels. We retrofit seven prevailing document-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection. Then we evaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection tasks. Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct fine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models show superior performance and better generalization across domains.

Code retrieval is critically important yet remains under-explored, with existing methods and benchmarks inadequately representing the diversity of code in various domains and tasks. Addressing this gap, we present COIR (Code Information Retrieval Benchmark), a robust and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess code retrieval capabilities. COIR comprises ten meticulously curated code datasets, spanning eight distinctive retrieval tasks across seven diverse domains. We first discuss the construction of COIR and its diverse dataset composition. Further, we evaluate nine widely used retrieval models using COIR, uncovering significant difficulties in performing code retrieval tasks even with state-of-the-art systems. To facilitate easy adoption and integration within existing research workflows, COIR has been developed as a user-friendly Python framework, readily installable via pip. It shares same data schema as other popular benchmarks like MTEB and BEIR, enabling seamless cross-benchmark evaluations. Through COIR, we aim to invigorate research in the code retrieval domain, providing a versatile benchmarking tool that encourages further development and exploration of code retrieval systems. https://github.com/CoIR-team/coir.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02883v3

Aligned but Blind: Alignment Increases Implicit Bias by Reducing Awareness of Race,"['Lihao Sun', 'Chengzhi Mao', 'Valentin Hofmann', 'Xuechunzi Bai']","Although value-aligned language models (LMs) appear unbiased in explicit bias evaluations, they often exhibit stereotypes in implicit word association tasks, raising concerns about their fair usage. We investigate the mechanisms behind this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers. In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans, ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00253v3
IOPO: Empowering LLMs with Complex Instruction Following via Input-Output Preference Optimization,"['Xinghua Zhang', 'Haiyang Yu', 'ChengFu', 'Fei Huang', 'Yongbin Li']","In the realm of large language models (LLMs), the ability of models to accurately follow instructions is paramount as more agents and applications leverage LLMs for construction, where the complexity of instructions are rapidly increasing. However, on the one hand, there is only a certain amount of complex instruction evaluation data; on the other hand, there are no dedicated algorithms to improve the ability to follow complex instructions. To this end, this paper introduces TRACE, a benchmark for improving and evaluating the complex instructionfollowing ability, which consists of 120K training data and 1K evaluation data. Furthermore, we propose IOPO (Input-Output Preference Optimization) alignment method which takes both input and output preference pairs into consideration, where LLMs not only rapidly align with response preferences but also meticulously explore the instruction preferences. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and outof-domain datasets confirm the effectiveness of IOPO, showing 8.15%, 2.18% improvements on in-domain data and 6.29%, 3.13% on outof-domain data compared to SFT and DPO respectively.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06208v2

Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open editing platforms.

Diversity-oriented Data Augmentation with Large Language Models,"['Zaitian Wang', 'Jinghan Zhang', 'Xinhao Zhang', 'Kunpeng Liu', 'pengfei wang', 'Yuanchun Zhou']","Data augmentation is an essential technique in natural language processing (NLP) for enriching training datasets by generating diverse samples. This process is crucial for improving the robustness and generalization capabilities of NLP models. However, a significant challenge remains: \textit{Insufficient Attention to Sample Distribution Diversity}. Most existing methods focus on increasing the sample numbers while neglecting the sample distribution diversity, which can lead to model overfitting. In response, we explore data augmentation's impact on dataset diversity and propose a \textbf{\underline{D}}iversity-\textbf{\underline{o}}riented data \textbf{\underline{Aug}}mentation framework (\textbf{DoAug}). % \(\mathscr{DoAug}\) Specifically, we utilize a diversity-oriented fine-tuning approach to train an LLM as a diverse paraphraser, which is capable of augmenting textual datasets by generating diversified paraphrases.

Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 12 real-world textual datasets. The results show that our fine-tuned LLM augmenter improves diversity while preserving label consistency, thereby enhancing the robustness and performance of downstream tasks. Specifically, it achieves an average performance gain of \(10.52\%\), surpassing the runner-up baseline with more than three percentage points.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11671v2
Can LLMs Understand Unvoiced Speech? Exploring EMG-to-Text Conversion with LLMs,"['Payal Mohapatra', 'Akash Pandey', 'Xiaoyuan Zhang', 'Qi Zhu']","Unvoiced electromyography (EMG) is an effective communication tool for individuals unable to produce vocal speech. However, most prior methods rely on paired voiced and unvoiced EMG signals, along with speech data, for EMG-to-text conversion, which is not practical for such individuals. Given the rise of large language models (LLMs) in speech recognition, we explore their potential to understand unvoiced speech. To this end, we address the challenge of learning from unvoiced EMG alone and propose a novel EMG adaptor module that maps EMG features into an LLM's input space, achieving an average word error rate (WER) of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task. Even with a conservative data availability of just six minutes, our approach improves performance over specialized models by nearly 20%. While LLMs have been shown to be extendable to new language modalities -- such as audio -- understanding articulatory biosignals like unvoiced EMG remains more challenging. This work takes a crucial first step toward enabling LLMs to comprehend unvoiced speech using surface EMG.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00304v1

Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization face two challenges: lack of diversity, limiting the exploration of valuable and innovative directions and semantic drift, where optimizations for one task can degrade performance in others. To address these issues, we propose Residual Optimization Tree (RiOT), a novel framework for automatic prompt optimization. RiOT iteratively refines prompts through text gradients, generating multiple semantically diverse candidates at each step, and selects the best prompt using perplexity. Additionally, RiOT incorporates the text residual connection to mitigate semantic drift by selectively retaining beneficial content across optimization iterations. A tree structure efficiently manages the optimization process, ensuring scalability and flexibility. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, covering commonsense, mathematical, logical, temporal, and semantic reasoning, demonstrate that RiOT outperforms both previous prompt optimization methods and manual prompting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16389v1

"Automatic Evaluation for Text-to-image Generation: Task-decomposed Framework, Distilled Training, and Meta-evaluation Benchmark","['Rong-Cheng Tu', 'Zi-Ao Ma', 'Tian Lan', 'Yuehao Zhao', 'Heyan Huang', 'Xian-Ling Mao']","Driven by the remarkable progress in diffusion models, text-to-image generation has made significant strides, creating a pressing demand for automatic quality evaluation of generated images. Current state-of-the-art automatic evaluation methods heavily rely on Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly powerful commercial models like GPT-4o. While these models are highly effective, their substantial costs limit scalability in large-scale evaluations. Adopting open-source MLLMs is an alternative; however, their performance falls short due to significant limitations in processing multi-modal data compared to commercial MLLMs. To tackle these problems, we first propose a task decomposition evaluation framework based on GPT-4o to automatically construct a new training dataset, where the complex evaluation task is decoupled into simpler sub-tasks, effectively reducing the learning complexity. Based on this dataset, we design innovative training strategies to effectively distill GPT-4o's evaluation capabilities into a 7B open-source MLLM, MiniCPM-V-2.6. Furthermore, to reliably and comprehensively assess prior works and our proposed model, we manually annotate a meta-evaluation benchmark that includes chain-of-thought explanations alongside quality scores for generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that our distilled open-source MLLM significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art GPT-4o-base baseline, VIEScore, with over 4.6\% improvement in Spearman and Kendall correlations with human judgments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15488v1
Mitigating Lost-in-Retrieval Problems in Retrieval Augmented Multi-Hop Question Answering,"['Rongzhi Zhu', 'Xiangyu Liu', 'Zequn Sun', 'Yiwei Wang', 'Wei Hu']","In this paper, we identify a critical problem, ""lost-in-retrieval"", in retrieval-augmented multi-hop question answering (QA): the key entities are missed in LLMs' sub-question decomposition. ""Lost-in-retrieval"" significantly degrades the retrieval performance, which disrupts the reasoning chain and leads to the incorrect answers. To resolve this problem, we propose a progressive retrieval and rewriting method, namely ChainRAG, which sequentially handles each sub-question by completing missing key entities and retrieving relevant sentences from a sentence graph for answer generation. Each step in our retrieval and rewriting process builds upon the previous one, creating a seamless chain that leads to accurate retrieval and answers. Finally, all retrieved sentences and sub-question answers are integrated to generate a comprehensive answer to the original question. We evaluate ChainRAG on three multi-hop QA datasets - MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and HotpotQA - using three large language models: GPT4o-mini, Qwen2.5-72B, and GLM-4-Plus. Empirical results demonstrate that ChainRAG consistently outperforms baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14245v2
TableLoRA: Low-rank Adaptation on Table Structure Understanding for Large Language Models,"['Xinyi He', 'Yihao Liu', 'Mengyu Zhou', 'Yeye He', 'Haoyu Dong', 'Shi Han', 'Zejian Yuan', 'Dongmei Zhang']","Tabular data are crucial in many fields and their understanding by large language models (LLMs) under high parameter efficiency paradigm is important. However, directly applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to tabular tasks presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of better table serialization and the representation of two-dimensional structured information within a one-dimensional sequence. To address this, we propose TableLoRA, a module designed to improve LLMs' understanding of table structure during PEFT. It incorporates special tokens for serializing tables with special token encoder and uses 2D LoRA to encode low-rank information on cell positions. Experiments on four tabular-related datasets demonstrate that TableLoRA consistently outperforms vanilla LoRA and surpasses various table encoding methods tested in control experiments. These findings reveal that TableLoRA, as a table-specific LoRA, enhances the ability of LLMs to process tabular data effectively, especially in low-parameter settings, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for handling table-related tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04396v2
Condor: Enhance LLM Alignment with Knowledge-Driven Data Synthesis and Refinement,"['Maosongcao', 'Taolin Zhang', 'Mo Li', 'Chuyu Zhang', 'Yunxin Liu', 'Conghui He', 'Haodong Duan', 'Songyang Zhang', 'Kai Chen']","The quality of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data plays a critical role in enhancing the conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

In this work, we introduce Condor, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation framework that incorporates World Knowledge Tree and Self-Reflection Refinement to produce high-quality SFT data at scale. Our experimental results demonstrate that a base model fine-tuned on only 20K Condor-generated samples achieves superior performance compared to counterparts. The additional refinement stage in Condor further enables iterative self-improvement for LLMs at various scales (up to 72B), validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Decoding Knowledge Attribution in Mixture-of-Experts: A Framework of Basic-Refinement Collaboration and Efficiency Analysis,"['Junzhuo Li', 'Bo Wang', 'Xiuze Zhou', 'Peijie Jiang', 'Jia Liu', 'Xuming Hu']","The interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, especially those with heterogeneous designs, remains underexplored. Existing attribution methods for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE, Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mistral-7B). Results show MoE models achieve 37% higher per-layer efficiency via a ""mid-activation, late-amplification"" pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a ""basic-refinement"" framework--shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination. Notably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates expert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10 experts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe degradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive tasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant tasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation. These insights advance MoE interpretability, offering principles to balance efficiency, specialization, and robustness.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24593v2

LESA: Learnable LLM Layer Scaling-Up,"['Yifei Yang', 'zouying cao', 'Xinbei Ma', 'Yao Yao', 'Zhi Chen', 'Libo Qin', 'hai zhao']","Training Large Language Models (LLMs) from scratch requires immense computational resources, making it prohibitively expensive. Model scaling-up offers a promising solution by leveraging the parameters of smaller models to create larger ones. However, existing depth scaling-up methods rely on empirical heuristic rules for layer duplication, which result in poorer initialization and slower convergence during continual pre-training. We propose \textbf{LESA}, a novel learnable method for depth scaling-up. By concatenating parameters from each layer and applying Singular Value Decomposition, we uncover latent patterns between layers, suggesting that inter-layer parameters can be learned. LESA uses a neural network to predict the parameters inserted between adjacent layers, enabling better initialization and faster training. Experiments show that LESA outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior performance with less than half the computational cost during continual pre-training.

With data collected from real-world scenarios, MMRC comprises 5,120 conversations and 28,720 corresponding manually labeled questions, posing a significant challenge to existing MLLMs. Evaluations on 20 MLLMs in MMRC indicate an accuracy drop during open-ended interactions. We identify four common failure patterns: long-term memory degradation, inadequacies in updating factual knowledge, accumulated assumption of error propagation, and reluctance to say no. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple yet effective NOTE-TAKING strategy, which can record key information from the conversation and remind the model during its responses, enhancing conversational capabilities.

Towards the Law of Capacity Gap in Distilling Language Models,"['Chen Zhang', 'Qiuchi Li', 'Dawei Song', 'Zheyu Ye', 'Yan Gao', 'Yao Hu']","Language model (LM) distillation is a trending area that aims to distil the knowledge residing in a large teacher LM to a small student one. While various methods have been proposed to maximize the effectiveness of the distillation, significant challenges persist, particularly when there is a substantial capacity gap between the teacher and student LMs. This issue, often referred to as the \textit{curse} of capacity gap, suggests that a larger teacher does not necessarily result in a superior student compared to one distilled from a smaller teacher. In other words, there is likely an optimal teacher yielding the best student along the scaling course of the teacher. However, the curse of capacity gap can not be tackled without notable compute overhead, as indicated in previous studies. In the context of large LMs (LLMs), previously viable approaches become much less meaningful, as it is an impossible triangle to distill an expected student from an optimal teacher student with small compute overhead. Fortunately, the impossible triangle can fortunately be possible provided an inducted \textit{law} of capacity gap. In this paper, we take the spirits of scaling law and reveal that the optimal teacher scale almost consistently follows a linear scaling with the student scale across different model architectures and data scales. The law later guides us to distil a 3B student LM (termed \textsc{MiniMA}) from LLaMA2-7B. \textsc{MiniMA} is demonstrated to outperform a wide range of 3B competitors and could even compete with several 7B models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07052v3

Despite this, the role of visual information in reasoning has been underexplored. Our findings show that existing multimodal mathematical models minimally leverage visual information, and model performance remains largely unaffected by changes to or removal of images in the dataset. We attribute this to the dominance of textual information and answer options that inadvertently guide the model to correct answers. To improve evaluation methods, we introduce the HC-M3D dataset, specifically designed to require image reliance for problem-solving and to challenge models with similar, yet distinct, images that change the correct answer. In testing leading models, their failure to detect these subtle visual differences suggests limitations in current visual perception capabilities.

Humans infer others' thoughts by integrating causal cues and indirect clues from broad contextual information, often derived from past interactions. In other words, human ToM heavily relies on the understanding about the backgrounds and life stories of others. Unfortunately, this aspect is largely overlooked in existing benchmarks for evaluating machines' ToM capabilities, due to their usage of short narratives without global context, especially personal background of characters. In this paper, we verify the importance of comprehensive contextual understanding about personal backgrounds in ToM and assess the performance of LLMs in such complex scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce CharToM benchmark, comprising 1,035 ToM questions based on characters from classic novels. Our human study reveals a significant disparity in performance: the same group of educated participants performs dramatically better when they have read the novels compared to when they have not. In parallel, our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including the very recent o1 and DeepSeek-R1 models, show that LLMs still perform notably worse than humans, despite that they have seen these stories during pre-training.

Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16529v2
STRICTA: Structured Reasoning in Critical Text Assessment for Peer Review and Beyond,"['Nils Dycke', 'Matej Zečević', 'Ilia Kuznetsov', 'Beatrix Suess', 'Kristian Kersting', 'Iryna Gurevych']","Critical text assessment is at the core of many expert activities, such as fact-checking, peer review, and essay grading. Yet, existing work treats critical text assessment as a black box problem, limiting interpretability and human-AI collaboration. To close this gap, we introduce Structured Reasoning In Critical Text Assessment (STRICTA), a novel specification framework to model text assessment as an explicit, step-wise reasoning process. STRICTA breaks down the assessment into a graph of interconnected reasoning steps drawing on causality theory (Pearl, 1995). This graph is populated based on expert interaction data and used to study the assessment process and facilitate human-AI collaboration. We formally define STRICTA and apply it in a study on biomedical paper assessment, resulting in a dataset of over 4000 reasoning steps from roughly 40 biomedical experts on more than 20 papers. We use this dataset to empirically study expert reasoning in critical text assessment, and investigate if LLMs are able to imitate and support experts within these workflows. The resulting tools and datasets pave the way for studying collaborative expert-AI reasoning in text assessment, in peer review and beyond.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05367v2

Existing Privacy-Preserving Transformer Inference (PPTI) frameworks face the ""impossible trinity"" of balancing privacy, efficiency, and performance: Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)-based approaches ensure strong privacy but suffer from high computational overhead and performance losses; Conversely, permutation-based methods achieve near-plaintext efficiency and accuracy but compromise privacy by exposing sensitive model parameters and intermediate results. Bridging this gap with a single approach presents substantial challenges, motivating the introduction of CENTAUR, a groundbreaking PPTI framework that seamlessly integrates random permutations and SMPC to address the ""impossible trinity"". By designing efficient PPTI algorithms tailored to the structural properties of Transformer models, CENTAUR achieves an unprecedented balance among privacy, efficiency, and performance. Our experiments demonstrate CENTAUR's ability to resist diverse data reconstruction attacks, achieve plaintext-level inference accuracy, and boost inference speed by 5.0-30.4 times, unlocking new possibilities for secure and efficient AI deployment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10652v2
"Silencing Empowerment, Allowing Bigotry: Auditing the Moderation of Hate Speech on Twitch","['Prarabdh Shukla', 'Wei Yin Chong', 'Yash Patel', 'Brennan Schaffner', 'Danish Pruthi', 'Arjun Bhagoji']","To meet the demands of content moderation, online platforms have resorted to automated systems. Newer forms of real-time engagement($\textit{e.g.}$, users commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence, relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool ($\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over $107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism, ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful messages, up to $94\%$ on some datasets, $\textit{bypass moderation}$. Contextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\%$ removal, revealing $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We also find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\texttt{AutoMod}$ blocks up to $89.5\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in pedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s capabilities and underscores the importance for such systems to understand context effectively.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07667v2

However, preparing such benchmarks in high quality native language is often costly and therefore limits the representativeness of evaluation datasets. While recent efforts focused on building more inclusive MMLU benchmarks, these are conventionally built using machine translation from high-resource languages, which may introduce errors and fail to account for the linguistic and cultural intricacies of the target languages. In this paper, we address the lack of native language MMLU benchmark especially in the under-represented Turkic language family with distinct morphosyntactic and cultural characteristics. We propose two benchmarks for Turkic language MMLU: TUMLU is a comprehensive, multilingual, and natively developed language understanding benchmark specifically designed for Turkic languages. It consists of middle- and high-school level questions spanning 11 academic subjects in Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar, Karakalpak, Kazakh, Tatar, Turkish, Uyghur, and Uzbek.

Current solutions incur prohibitive training costs, leaving statistical behaviors and cost-effective approaches underexplored. From the decoding perspective, we identify the Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA) phenomenon, where the salience ratio correlates with long-text performance degradation. Notably, despite the attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates attention score degradation.

A Statistical and Multi-Perspective Revisiting of the Membership Inference Attack in Large Language Models,"['Bowen Chen', 'Namgi Han', 'Yusuke Miyao']","The lack of data transparency in Large Language Models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of Membership Inference Attack (MIA), which differentiates trained (member) and untrained (non-member) data.

We assume that a single setting doesn't represent the distribution of the vast corpora, causing members and non-members with different distributions to be sampled and causing inconsistency. In this study, instead of a single setting, we statistically revisit MIA methods from various settings with thousands of experiments for each MIA method, along with study in text feature, embedding, threshold decision, and decoding dynamics of members and non-members. We found that (1) MIA performance improves with model size and varies with domains, while most methods do not statistically outperform baselines, (2) Though MIA performance is generally low, a notable amount of differentiable member and non-member outliers exists and vary across MIA methods, (3) Deciding a threshold to separate members and non-members is an overlooked challenge, (4) Text dissimilarity and long text benefit MIA performance, (5) Differentiable or not is reflected in the LLM embedding, (6) Member and non-members show different decoding dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13475v1
Around the World in 24 Hours: Probing LLM Knowledge of Time and Place,"['Carolin Holtermann', 'Paul Röttger', 'Anne Lauscher']","Reasoning over time and space is essential for understanding our world. However, the abilities of language models in this area are largely unexplored as previous work has tested their abilities for logical reasoning in terms of time and space in isolation or only in simple or artificial environments. In this paper, we present the first evaluation of the ability of language models to jointly reason over time and space. To enable our analysis, we create GeoTemp, a dataset of 320k prompts covering 289 cities in 217 countries and 37 time zones. Using GeoTemp, we evaluate eight open chat models of three different model families for different combinations of temporal and geographic knowledge. We find that most models perform well on reasoning tasks involving only temporal knowledge and that overall performance improves with scale. However, performance remains constrained in tasks that require connecting temporal and geographical information. We do not find clear correlations of performance with specific geographic regions. Instead, we find a significant performance increase for location names with low model perplexity, suggesting their repeated occurrence during model training. We further demonstrate that their performance is heavily influenced by prompt formulation - a direct injection of geographical knowledge leads to performance gains, whereas, surprisingly, techniques like chain-of-thought prompting decrease performance on simpler tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03984v1

VITAL: A New Dataset for Benchmarking Pluralistic Alignment in Healthcare,"['Anudeex Shetty', 'Amin Beheshti', 'Mark Dras', 'Usman Naseem']","Alignment techniques have become central to ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate outputs consistent with human values. However, existing alignment paradigms often model an averaged or monolithic preference, failing to account for the diversity of perspectives across cultures, demographics, and communities. This limitation is particularly critical in health-related scenarios, where plurality is essential due to the influence of culture, religion, personal values, and conflicting opinions. Despite progress in pluralistic alignment, no prior work has focused on health, likely due to the unavailability of publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a new benchmark dataset comprising 13.1K value-laden situations and 5.4K multiple-choice questions focused on health, designed to assess and benchmark pluralistic alignment methodologies. Through extensive evaluation of eight LLMs of varying sizes, we demonstrate that existing pluralistic alignment techniques fall short in effectively accommodating diverse healthcare beliefs, underscoring the need for tailored AI alignment in specific domains.

Are We in the AI-Generated Text World Already? Quantifying and Monitoring AIGT on Social Media,"['Zhen Sun', 'Zongmin Zhang', 'Xinyue Shen', 'Ziyi Zhang', 'Yule Liu', 'Michael Backes', 'Yang Zhang', 'Xinlei He']","Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, it remains unclear how prevalent AIGTs are on social media. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify and monitor the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024, using the AI Attribution Rate (AAR) as the metric. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs on social media differ from human-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our analysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future research in this domain.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18148v3

HoPE: A Novel Positional Encoding Without Long-Term Decay for Enhanced Context Awareness and Extrapolation,"['Yuhan Chen', 'Ang Lv', 'Jian Luan', 'Bin Wang', 'Wei Liu']","Many positional encodings (PEs) are designed to exhibit long-term decay, based on an entrenched and long-standing inductive opinion: tokens farther away from the current position carry less relevant information. We argue that long-term decay is outdated in the era of LLMs, as LLMs are now applied to tasks demanding precise retrieval of in-context information from arbitrary positions. Firstly, we present empirical analyses on various PEs, demonstrating that models inherently learn attention with only a local-decay pattern while forming a U-shape pattern globally, contradicting the principle of long-term decay. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of rotary position encoding (RoPE, a prevalent relative positional encoding in LLMs), and found that the U-shape attention is caused by some learned components, which are also the key factor limiting RoPE's expressiveness and extrapolation.Inspired by these insights, we propose High-frequency rotary Position Encoding (HoPE). HoPE replaces the specific components in RoPE with position-independent ones, retaining only high-frequency signals, which also breaks the principle of long-term decay in theory. HoPE achieves two major advantages: (1) Without constraints imposed by long-term decay, contradictory factors that limit spontaneous attention optimization and model extrapolation performance are removed. (2) Components representing positions and semantics are are optimized. These enhances model's context awareness and extrapolation, as validated by extensive experiments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21216v2
One QuantLLM for ALL: Fine-tuning Quantized LLMs Once for Efficient Deployments,"['Ke Yi', 'Yuhui Xu', 'Heng Chang', 'Yuan Meng', 'Tong Zhang', 'Jia Li']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly but face significant memory demands. While quantization has shown promise for LLMs, current methods typically require lengthy training to alleviate the performance degradation from quantization loss. However, deploying LLMs across diverse scenarios with different resource constraints, e.g., servers and personal computers, requires repeated training per application, which amplifies the lengthy training problem. Given that, it is advantageous to train a once-for-all (OFA) supernet capable of yielding diverse optimal subnets for downstream applications through one-shot training. Nonetheless, the scale of current language models impedes efficiency and amplifies interference from weight sharing between subnets. We make an initial attempt to extend the once-for-all framework to large language models. Specifically, we decouple shared weights to eliminate the interference and incorporate Low-Rank adapters for training efficiency. Furthermore, we observe the imbalance allocation of training resources from the traditional uniform sampling. A non-parametric scheduler is introduced to adjust the sampling rate for each quantization configuration, achieving a more balanced allocation among subnets with varying demands. We validate the approach on LLaMA2 families, and downstream evaluation confirms our ability to maintain high performance while significantly reducing deployment time faced with multiple scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20202v1

NSA employs a dynamic hierarchical sparse strategy, combining coarse-grained token compression with fine-grained token selection to preserve both global context awareness and local precision. Our approach advances sparse attention design with two key innovations: (1) We achieve substantial speedups through arithmetic intensity-balanced algorithm design, with implementation optimizations for modern hardware. (2) We enable end-to-end training, reducing pretraining computation without sacrificing model performance. As shown in Figure 1, experiments show the model pretrained with NSA maintains or exceeds Full Attention models across general benchmarks, long-context tasks, and instruction-based reasoning.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for continuous-space reasoning that does not require modifying the LLM.

FCMR: Robust Evaluation of Financial Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning,"['Seunghee Kim', 'Changhyeon Kim', 'Taeuk Kim']","Real-world decision-making often requires integrating and reasoning over information from multiple modalities.

Existing benchmarks, such as MMQA, face challenges due to (1) data contamination and (2) a lack of complex queries that necessitate operations across more than two modalities, hindering accurate performance assessment. To address this, we present Financial Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning (FCMR), a benchmark created to analyze the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs by urging them to combine information from textual reports, tables, and charts within the financial domain. FCMR is categorized into three difficulty levels-Easy, Medium, and Hard-facilitating a step-by-step evaluation. In particular, problems at the Hard level require precise cross-modal three-hop reasoning and are designed to prevent the disregard of any modality. Experiments on this new benchmark reveal that even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle, with the best-performing model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) achieving only 30.4% accuracy on the most challenging tier.

This interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE) to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However, these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue of locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled knowledge components to enhance safety.

Empirically, we demonstrate the $\mathbf{elasticity}$ of post-alignment models, i.e., the tendency to revert to the behavior distribution formed during the pre-training phase upon further fine-tuning. Leveraging compression theory, we formally deduce that fine-tuning disproportionately undermines alignment relative to pre-training, potentially by orders of magnitude. We validate the presence of elasticity through experiments on models of varying types and scales. Specifically, we find that model performance declines rapidly before reverting to the pre-training distribution, after which the rate of decline drops significantly. Furthermore, we further reveal that elasticity positively correlates with the increased model size and the expansion of pre-training data. Our findings underscore the need to address the inherent elasticity of LLMs to mitigate their resistance to alignment.

We rely on theoretical and empirical connections to Transformer-based architectures and their attention mechanisms. Exploiting this relationship, we adapt attentional interpretability techniques originally developed for Transformers--specifically, the Attention Knockout methodology--to both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2. Using them we trace how information is transmitted and localized across tokens and layers, revealing patterns of subject-token information emergence and layer-wise dynamics. Notably, some phenomena vary between mamba models and Transformer based models, while others appear universally across all models inspected--hinting that these may be inherent to LLMs in general. By further leveraging Mamba's structured factorization, we disentangle how distinct ""features"" either enable token-to-token information exchange or enrich individual tokens, thus offering a unified lens to understand Mamba internal operations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24244v1

Curiosity-Driven Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback,"['Haoran Sun', 'Yekun Chai', 'Shuohuan Wang', 'Yu Sun', 'Hua Wu', 'Haifeng Wang']","Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, but often at the cost of reduced output diversity. This trade-off between diversity and alignment quality remains a significant challenge. Drawing inspiration from curiosity-driven exploration in reinforcement learning, we introduce curiosity-driven RLHF (CD-RLHF), a framework that incorporates intrinsic rewards for novel states, alongside traditional sparse extrinsic rewards, to optimize both output diversity and alignment quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CD-RLHF through extensive experiments on a range of tasks, including text summarization and instruction following. Our approach achieves significant gains in diversity on multiple diversity-oriented metrics while maintaining alignment with human preferences comparable to standard RLHF.

However, current state-of-the-art T2A models still struggle to satisfy human preferences for prompt-following and acoustic quality when generating complex multi-event audio. To improve the performance of the model in these high-level applications, we propose to enhance the basic capabilities of the model with AI feedback learning. First, we introduce fine-grained AI audio scoring pipelines to: 1) verify whether each event in the text prompt is present in the audio (Event Occurrence Score), 2) detect deviations in event sequences from the language description (Event Sequence Score), and 3) assess the overall acoustic and harmonic quality of the generated audio (Acoustic&Harmonic Quality). We evaluate these three automatic scoring pipelines and find that they correlate significantly better with human preferences than other evaluation metrics. This highlights their value as both feedback signals and evaluation metrics. Utilizing our robust scoring pipelines, we construct a large audio preference dataset, T2A-FeedBack, which contains 41k prompts and 249k audios, each accompanied by detailed scores. Moreover, we introduce T2A-EpicBench, a benchmark that focuses on long captions, multi-events, and story-telling scenarios, aiming to evaluate the advanced capabilities of T2A models. Finally, we demonstrate how T2A-FeedBack can enhance current state-of-the-art audio model.

Generating Plausible Distractors for Multiple-Choice Questions via Student Choice Prediction,"['Yooseop Lee', 'Suin Kim', 'Yohan Jo']","In designing multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in education, creating plausible distractors is crucial for identifying students' misconceptions and gaps in knowledge and accurately assessing their understanding. However, prior studies on distractor generation have not paid sufficient attention to enhancing the difficulty of distractors, resulting in reduced effectiveness of MCQs. This study presents a pipeline for training a model to generate distractors that are more likely to be selected by students. First, we train a pairwise ranker to reason about students' misconceptions and assess the relative plausibility of two distractors. Using this model, we create a dataset of pairwise distractor ranks and then train a distractor generator via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate more plausible distractors. Experiments on computer science subjects (Python, DB, MLDL) demonstrate that our pairwise ranker effectively identifies students' potential misunderstandings and achieves ranking accuracy comparable to human experts. Furthermore, our distractor generator outperforms several baselines in generating plausible distractors and produces questions with a higher item discrimination index (DI).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13125v3

However, it often struggles to generalize beyond the distribution of the provided demonstrations. A recent advancement in enhancing robustness is ICL with explanations (X-ICL), which improves prediction reliability by guiding LLMs to understand and articulate the reasoning behind correct labels. Building on this approach, we introduce an advanced framework that extends X-ICL by systematically exploring explanations for all possible labels (X$^2$-ICL), thereby enabling more comprehensive and robust decision-making. Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding datasets validate the effectiveness of X$^2$-ICL, demonstrating significantly improved robustness to out-of-distribution data compared to the existing ICL approaches.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02378v1

However, a gap still remains between validation loss and the model's downstream capabilities, making it untrivial to apply scaling law to direct performance prediction for downstream tasks. The loss typically represents a cumulative penalty for predicted tokens, which are implicitly considered to have equal importance. Nevertheless, our studies have shown evidence that when considering different training data distributions, we cannot directly model the relationship between downstream capability and computation or token loss. To bridge the gap between validation loss and downstream task capabilities, in this work, we introduce Capability Salience Vector, which decomposes the overall loss and assigns different importance weights to tokens to assess a specific meta-capability, aligning the validation loss with downstream task performance in terms of the model's capabilities.

Graph of Records: Boosting Retrieval Augmented Generation for Long-context Summarization with Graphs,"['Haozhen Zhang', 'Tao Feng', 'Jiaxuan You']","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has revitalized Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting non-parametric factual knowledge. Compared with long-context LLMs, RAG is considered an effective summarization tool in a more concise and lightweight manner, which can interact with LLMs multiple times using diverse queries to get comprehensive responses. However, the LLM-generated historical responses, which contain potentially insightful information, are largely neglected and discarded by existing approaches, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose $\textit{graph of records}$ ($\textbf{GoR}$), which leverages historical responses generated by LLMs to enhance RAG for long-context global summarization. Inspired by the $\textit{retrieve-then-generate}$ paradigm of RAG, we construct a graph by establishing an edge between the retrieved text chunks and the corresponding LLM-generated response. To further uncover the intricate correlations between them, GoR features a $\textit{graph neural network}$ and an elaborately designed $\textit{BERTScore}$-based objective for self-supervised model training, enabling seamless supervision signal backpropagation between reference summaries and node embeddings. We comprehensively compare GoR with 12 baselines across four long-context summarization datasets, and the results indicate that our proposed method reaches the best performance ($\textit{e.g.}$, 15%, 8%, and 19% improvement over retrievers w.r.t.

On these benchmarks, BERT-like transformers have consistently performed best, reinforcing the belief that such models are broadly applicable across diverse contexts of debate. This study offers the first large-scale re-evaluation of such state-of-the-art models, with a specific focus on their ability to generalize in identifying arguments. We evaluate four transformers, three standard and one enhanced with contrastive pre-training for better generalization, on 17 English sentence-level datasets as most relevant to the task. Our findings show that, to varying degrees, these models tend to rely on lexical shortcuts tied to content words, suggesting that apparent progress may often be driven by dataset-specific cues rather than true task alignment.

Sparse-to-Dense: A Free Lunch for Lossless Acceleration of Video Understanding in LLMs,"['Xuan Zhang', 'Cunxiao Du', 'Sicheng Yu', 'Jiawei Wu', 'Fengzhuo Zhang', 'Wei Gao', 'Qian Liu']","Due to the auto-regressive nature of current video large language models (Video-LLMs), the inference latency increases as the input sequence length grows, posing challenges for the efficient processing of video sequences that are usually very long. We observe that during decoding, the attention scores of most tokens in Video-LLMs tend to be sparse and concentrated, with only certain tokens requiring comprehensive full attention. Based on this insight, we introduce Sparse-to-Dense (StD), a novel decoding strategy that integrates two distinct modules: one leveraging sparse top-K attention and the other employing dense full attention. These modules collaborate to accelerate Video-LLMs without loss. The fast (sparse) model speculatively decodes multiple tokens, while the slow (dense) model verifies them in parallel. StD is a tuning-free, plug-and-play solution that achieves up to a 1.94$\times$ walltime speedup in video processing.

First, we formally prove that any mutual bias non-randomly skews AUROC rankings, compromising benchmark integrity. Second, we confirm this happens empirically by testing 7 widely used correctness functions, from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to LM-as-a-judge approaches, across 4 datasets x 4 models x 8 UQ methods.

Evaluating the Evaluation of Diversity in Commonsense Generation,"['Tianhui Zhang', 'Bei Peng', 'Danushka Bollegala']","In commonsense generation, given a set of input concepts, a model must generate a response that is not only commonsense bearing, but also capturing multiple diverse viewpoints. Numerous evaluation metrics based on form- and content-level overlap have been proposed in prior work for evaluating the diversity of a commonsense generation model. However, it remains unclear as to which metrics are best suited for evaluating the diversity in commonsense generation. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of diversity metrics for commonsense generation. We find that form-based diversity metrics tend to consistently overestimate the diversity in sentence sets, where even randomly generated sentences are assigned overly high diversity scores. We then use an Large Language Model (LLM) to create a novel dataset annotated for the diversity of sentences generated for a commonsense generation task, and use it to conduct a meta-evaluation of the existing diversity evaluation metrics. Our experimental results show that content-based diversity evaluation metrics consistently outperform the form-based counterparts, showing high correlations with the LLM-based ratings.

Our experiments on datasets like Natural Questions, HotpotQA, and MMLU reveal that LLMs demonstrate significant pre-generation perception, which is further refined post-generation, with perception gaps remaining stable across varying conditions. To mitigate risks in critical domains, we introduce Confidence Consistency-based Calibration ($C^3$), which assesses confidence consistency through question reformulation. $C^3$ significantly improves LLMs' ability to recognize their knowledge gaps, enhancing the unknown perception rate by 5.6% on NQ and 4.9% on HotpotQA. Our findings suggest that pre-generation confidence estimation can optimize efficiency, while $C^3$ effectively controls output risks, advancing the reliability of LLMs in practical applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11677v2
ALGEN: Few-shot Inversion Attacks on Textual Embeddings using Alignment and Generation,"['Yiyi Chen', 'Qiongkai Xu', 'Johannes Bjerva']","With the growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases, private textual data is increasingly processed and stored as numerical embeddings. However, recent studies have proven that such embeddings are vulnerable to inversion attacks, where original text is reconstructed to reveal sensitive information. Previous research has largely assumed access to millions of sentences to train attack models, e.g., through data leakage or nearly unrestricted API access. With our method, a single data point is sufficient for a partially successful inversion attack. With as little as 1k data samples, performance reaches an optimum across a range of black-box encoders, without training on leaked data. We present a Few-shot Textual Embedding Inversion Attack using ALignment and GENeration (ALGEN), by aligning victim embeddings to the attack space and using a generative model to reconstruct text. We find that ALGEN attacks can be effectively transferred across domains and languages, revealing key information. We further examine a variety of defense mechanisms against ALGEN, and find that none are effective, highlighting the vulnerabilities posed by inversion attacks. By significantly lowering the cost of inversion and proving that embedding spaces can be aligned through one-step optimization, we establish a new textual embedding inversion paradigm with broader applications for embedding alignment in NLP.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11308v2
Decoding on Graphs: Faithful and Sound Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs through Generation of Well-Formed Chains,"['Kun LI', 'Tianhua Zhang', 'Xixin Wu', 'Hongyin Luo', 'James R. Glass', 'Helen M. Meng']","Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can serve as reliable knowledge sources for question answering (QA) due to their structured representation of knowledge. Existing research on the utilization of KG for large language models (LLMs) prevalently relies on subgraph retriever or iterative prompting, overlooking the potential synergy of LLMs' step-wise reasoning capabilities and KGs' structural nature. In this paper, we present DoG (Decoding on Graphs), a novel framework that facilitates a deep synergy between LLMs and KGs. We first define a concept, well-formed chain, which consists of a sequence of interrelated fact triplets on the KGs, starting from question entities and leading to answers. We argue that this concept can serve as a principle for making faithful and sound reasoning for KGQA. To enable LLMs to generate well-formed chains, we propose graph-aware constrained decoding, in which a constraint derived from the topology of the KG regulates the decoding process of the LLMs. This constrained decoding method ensures the generation of well-formed chains while making full use of the step-wise reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Based on the above, DoG, a training-free approach, is able to provide faithful and sound reasoning trajectories grounded on the KGs. Experiments across various KGQA tasks with different background KGs demonstrate that DoG achieves superior and robust performance. DoG also shows general applicability with various open-source LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18415v1
STaR-SQL: Self-Taught Reasoner for Text-to-SQL,"['Mingqian He', 'Yongliang Shen', 'Wenqi Zhang', 'Qiuying Peng', 'Jun Wang', 'Weiming Lu']","Generating step-by-step ""chain-of-thought"" rationales has proven effective for improving the performance of large language models on complex reasoning tasks. However, applying such techniques to structured tasks, such as text-to-SQL, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Self-Taught Reasoner for text-to-SQL (STaR-SQL), a novel approach that reframes SQL query generation as a reasoning-driven process. Our method prompts the LLM to produce detailed reasoning steps for SQL queries and fine-tunes it on rationales that lead to correct outcomes. Unlike traditional methods, STaR-SQL dedicates additional test-time computation to reasoning, thereby positioning LLMs as spontaneous reasoners rather than mere prompt-based agents. To further scale the inference process, we incorporate an outcome-supervised reward model (ORM) as a verifier, which enhances SQL query accuracy. Experimental results on the challenging Spider benchmark demonstrate that STaR-SQL significantly improves text-to-SQL performance, achieving an execution accuracy of 86.6%. This surpasses a few-shot baseline by 31.6% and a baseline fine-tuned to predict answers directly by 18.0%. Additionally, STaR-SQL outperforms agent-like prompting methods that leverage more powerful yet closed-source models such as GPT-4. These findings underscore the potential of reasoning-augmented training for structured tasks and open the door to extending self-improving reasoning models to text-to-SQL generation and beyond.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13550v1

However, the limited availability of domain-specific data significantly hampers their performance on specialized tasks. While existing methods primarily focus on selecting training data from general datasets that are similar to the target domain, they often fail to consider the joint distribution of instructions, resulting in inefficient learning and suboptimal knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, we introduce G2IS (Gradient-based Graph Instruction Selection), a novel method that constructs a mixed gradient-based instruction graph to capture the joint distribution and interdependencies between instructions. By accounting for the relationships between instructions, G2IS improves domain adaptation efficiency. Additionally, we propose a gradient walk algorithm to refine the data selection process, enhancing both training effectiveness and efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that G2IS outperforms traditional methods across various domain adaptation tasks, yielding significant performance gains, particularly in complex, data-scarce scenarios. These results underscore the potential of G2IS in advancing the development of large, domain-specific models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11062v1
FastMCTS: A Simple Sampling Strategy for Data Synthesis,"['Peiji Li', 'Kai Lv', 'Yunfan Shao', 'Yichuan Ma', 'Linyang Li', 'Xiaoqing Zheng', 'Xipeng Qiu', 'Qipeng Guo']","Synthetic high-quality multi-step reasoning data can significantly enhance the performance of large language models on various tasks. However, most existing methods rely on rejection sampling, which generates trajectories independently and suffers from inefficiency and imbalanced sampling across problems of varying difficulty. In this work, we introduce FastMCTS, an innovative data synthesis strategy inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search. FastMCTS provides a more efficient sampling method for multi-step reasoning data, offering step-level evaluation signals and promoting balanced sampling across problems of different difficulty levels. Experiments on both English and Chinese reasoning datasets demonstrate that FastMCTS generates over 30\% more correct reasoning paths compared to rejection sampling as the number of generated tokens scales up. Furthermore, under comparable synthetic data budgets, models trained on FastMCTS-generated data outperform those trained on rejection sampling data by 3.9\% across multiple benchmarks. As a lightweight sampling strategy, FastMCTS offers a practical and efficient alternative for synthesizing high-quality reasoning data. Our code will be released soon.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11476v1

"Using Information Theory to Characterize Prosodic Typology: The Case of Tone, Pitch-Accent and Stress-Accent","['Ethan Wilcox', 'Cui Ding', 'Giovanni Acampa', 'Tiago Pimentel', 'Alex Warstadt', 'Tamar I Regev']","This paper argues that the relationship between lexical identity and prosody -- one well-studied parameter of linguistic variation -- can be characterized using information theory. We predict that languages that use prosody to make lexical distinctions should exhibit a higher mutual information between word identity and prosody, compared to languages that don't. We test this hypothesis in the domain of pitch, which is used to make lexical distinctions in tonal languages, like Cantonese. We use a dataset of speakers reading sentences aloud in ten languages across five language families to estimate the mutual information between the text and their pitch curves. We find that, across languages, pitch curves display similar amounts of entropy. However, these curves are easier to predict given their associated text in the tonal languages, compared to pitch- and stress-accent languages, and thus the mutual information is higher in these languages, supporting our hypothesis. Our results support perspectives that view linguistic typology as gradient, rather than categorical.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07659v2

LaTIM: Measuring Latent Token-to-Token Interactions in Mamba Models,"['Hugo Pitorro', 'Marcos Vinicius Treviso']","State space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have emerged as an efficient alternative to transformers for long-context sequence modeling. However, despite their growing adoption, SSMs lack the interpretability tools that have been crucial for understanding and improving attention-based architectures. While recent efforts provide insights into Mamba's internal mechanisms, they do not explicitly decompose token-wise contributions, leaving gaps in understanding how Mamba selectively processes sequences across layers. In this work, we introduce LaTIM, a novel token-level decomposition method for both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2 that enables fine-grained interpretability. We extensively evaluate our method across diverse tasks, including machine translation, copying, and retrieval-based generation, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing Mamba's token-to-token interaction patterns.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15612v2
Memorization Inheritance in Sequence-Level Knowledge Distillation for Neural Machine Translation,"['Verna Dankers', 'Vikas Raunak']","In this work, we explore how instance-level memorization in the teacher Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model gets inherited by the student model in sequence-level knowledge distillation (SeqKD). We find that despite not directly seeing the original training data, students memorize more than baseline models (models of the same size, trained on the original data) -- 3.4% for exact matches and 57% for extractive memorization -- and show increased hallucination rates. Further, under this SeqKD setting, we also characterize how students behave on specific training data subgroups, such as subgroups with low quality and specific counterfactual memorization (CM) scores, and find that students exhibit amplified denoising on low-quality subgroups. Finally, we propose a modification to SeqKD named Adaptive-SeqKD, which intervenes in SeqKD to reduce memorization and hallucinations. Overall, we recommend caution when applying SeqKD: students inherit both their teachers' superior performance and their fault modes, thereby requiring active monitoring.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01491v1
Improving Low-Resource Morphological Inflection via Self-Supervised Objectives,"['Adam Wiemerslage', 'Katharina von der Wense']","Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives. Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited, while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM. However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource morphological modeling.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05227v1

The effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval, which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation. Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07879v1

Retrospective Learning from Interactions,"['Zizhao Chen', 'Mustafa Omer Gul', 'Yiwei Chen', 'Gloria Geng', 'Anne Wu', 'Yoav Artzi']","Multi-turn interactions between large language models (LLMs) and users naturally include implicit feedback signals. If an LLM responds in an unexpected way to an instruction, the user is likely to signal it by rephrasing the request, expressing frustration, or pivoting to an alternative task. Such signals are task-independent and occupy a relatively constrained subspace of language, allowing the LLM to identify them even if it fails on the actual task. We introduce ReSpect, a method to learn from such signals in past interactions via retrospection without additional annotations. We deploy ReSpect in a new multimodal interaction scenario, where humans instruct a multimodal LLM to solve an abstract reasoning task with a combinatorial solution space. Through thousands of interactions with humans, we show how ReSpect gradually improves task completion rate from 31% to 82%, all without any external annotation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13852v2

Graph Counselor: Adaptive Graph Exploration via Multi-Agent Synergy to Enhance LLM Reasoning,"['Junqi Gao', 'Xiang Zou', 'Ying Ai', 'Dong Li', 'Yichen Niu', 'Biqing Qi', 'Jianxing Liu']","Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) effectively enhances external knowledge integration capabilities by explicitly modeling knowledge relationships, thereby improving the factual accuracy and generation quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. However, existing methods suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation: They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor, an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought, and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth. Additionally, the Self-Reflection with Multiple Perspectives (SR) module improves the accuracy and semantic consistency of reasoning results through self-reflection and backward reasoning mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that Graph Counselor outperforms existing methods in multiple graph reasoning tasks, exhibiting higher reasoning accuracy and generalization ability.

However, this probing method has limited stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions. Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM.

In this paper, we identify a new safety vulnerability in LLMs: their susceptibility to \textit{natural distribution shifts} between attack prompts and original toxic prompts, where seemingly benign prompts, semantically related to harmful content, can bypass safety mechanisms. To explore this issue, we introduce a novel attack method, \textit{ActorBreaker}, which identifies actors related to toxic prompts within pre-training distribution to craft multi-turn prompts that gradually lead LLMs to reveal unsafe content. ActorBreaker is grounded in Latour's actor-network theory, encompassing both human and non-human actors to capture a broader range of vulnerabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that ActorBreaker outperforms existing attack methods in terms of diversity, effectiveness, and efficiency across aligned LLMs. To address this vulnerability, we propose expanding safety training to cover a broader semantic space of toxic content. We thus construct a multi-turn safety dataset using ActorBreaker. Fine-tuning models on our dataset shows significant improvements in robustness, though with some trade-offs in utility.

We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs (and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines.

RefreshKV: Updating Small KV Cache During Long-form Generation,"['Fangyuan Xu', 'Tanya Goyal', 'Eunsol Choi']","Generating long sequences of tokens given a long-context input is a very compute-intensive inference scenario for large language models (LLMs). One prominent inference speed-up approach is to construct a smaller key-value (KV) cache, relieving LLMs from computing attention over a long sequence of tokens. While such methods work well to generate short sequences, their performance degrades rapidly for long-form generation. Most KV compression happens once, prematurely removing tokens that can be useful later in the generation. We propose a new inference method, RefreshKV, that flexibly alternates between full context attention and attention over a subset of input tokens during generation. After each full attention step, we update the smaller KV cache based on the attention pattern over the entire input. Applying our method to off-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to eviction-based methods while improving performance for various long-form generation tasks. Lastly, we show that continued pretraining with our inference setting brings further gains in performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05787v2
SEA: Low-Resource Safety Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models via Synthetic Embeddings,"['Weikai Lu', 'Hao Peng', 'Huiping Zhuang', 'Cen Chen', 'Ziqian Zeng']","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have serious security vulnerabilities.While safety alignment using multimodal datasets consisting of text and data of additional modalities can effectively enhance MLLM's security, it is costly to construct these datasets. Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks introduced by video and audio, we also introduced a new benchmark called VA-SafetyBench. High attack success rates across multiple MLLMs validate its challenge.

Language Models Grow Less Humanlike beyond Phase Transition,"['Tatsuya Aoyama', 'Ethan Wilcox']","LMs' alignment with human reading behavior (i.e. psychometric predictive power; PPP) is known to improve during pretraining up to a tipping point, beyond which it either plateaus or degrades. Various factors, such as word frequency, recency bias in attention, and context size, have been theorized to affect PPP, yet there is no current account that explains why such a tipping point exists, and how it interacts with LMs' pretraining dynamics more generally. We hypothesize that the underlying factor is a pretraining phase transition, characterized by the rapid emergence of specialized attention heads. We conduct a series of correlational and causal experiments to show that such a phase transition is responsible for the tipping point in PPP. We then show that, rather than producing attention patterns that contribute to the degradation in PPP, phase transitions alter the subsequent learning dynamics of the model, such that further training keeps damaging PPP.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18802v2

Through systematic evaluation using MC-SIGNS, we uncover critical limitations: text-to-image (T2I) systems exhibit strong US-centric biases, performing better at detecting offensive gestures in US contexts than in non-US ones; large language models (LLMs) tend to over-flag gestures as offensive; and vision-language models (VLMs) default to US-based interpretations when responding to universal concepts like wishing someone luck, frequently suggesting culturally inappropriate gestures.

500xCompressor: Generalized Prompt Compression for Large Language Models,"['Zongqian Li', 'Yixuan Su', 'Nigel Collier']","Prompt compression is crucial for enhancing inference speed, reducing costs, and improving user experience. However, current methods face challenges such as low compression ratios and potential data leakage during evaluation. To address these issues, we propose 500xCompressor, a method that compresses extensive natural language contexts into a minimum of one single special token. The 500xCompressor introduces approximately 0.3% additional parameters and achieves compression ratios ranging from 6x to 480x. It is designed to compress any text, answer various types of questions, and could be utilized by the original large language model (LLM) without requiring fine-tuning. Initially, 500xCompressor was pretrained on the Arxiv Corpus, followed by fine-tuning on the ArxivQA dataset, and subsequently evaluated on strictly unseen and classical question answering (QA) datasets. The results demonstrate that the LLM retained 62.26-72.89% of its capabilities compared to using non-compressed prompts. This study also shows that not all the compressed tokens are equally utilized and that K V values have significant advantages over embeddings in preserving information at high compression ratios. The highly compressive nature of natural language prompts, even for fine-grained complex information, suggests promising potential for future applications and further research into developing a new LLM language.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03094v1
Estimating Privacy Leakage of Augmented Contextual Knowledge in Language Models,"['James Flemings', 'Bo Jiang', 'Wanrong Zhang', 'Zafar Takhirov', 'Murali Annavaram']","Language models (LMs) rely on their parametric knowledge augmented with relevant contextual knowledge for certain tasks, such as question answering. However, the contextual knowledge can contain private information that may be leaked when answering queries, and estimating this privacy leakage is not well understood. A straightforward approach of directly comparing an LM's output to the contexts can overestimate the privacy risk, since the LM's parametric knowledge might already contain the augmented contextual knowledge. To this end, we introduce *context influence*, a metric that builds on differential privacy, a widely-adopted privacy notion, to estimate the privacy leakage of contextual knowledge during decoding. Our approach effectively measures how each subset of the context influences an LM's response while separating the specific parametric knowledge of the LM. Using our context influence metric, we demonstrate that context privacy leakage occurs when contextual knowledge is out of distribution with respect to parametric knowledge. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate how context influence properly attributes the privacy leakage to augmented contexts, and we evaluate how factors -- such as model size, context size, generation position, etc. -- affect context privacy leakage. The practical implications of our results will inform practitioners of the privacy risk associated with augmented contextual knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03026v2

In this work, we address the question by quantitatively examining NLP research papers. We propose a taxonomy of research contributions and introduce NLPContributions, a dataset of nearly $2k$ NLP research paper abstracts, carefully annotated to identify scientific contributions and classify their types according to this taxonomy. We also introduce a novel task of automatically identifying contribution statements and classifying their types from research papers. We present experimental results for this task and apply our model to $\sim$$29k$ NLP research papers to analyze their contributions, aiding in the understanding of the nature of NLP research. We show that NLP research has taken a winding path -- with the focus on language and human-centric studies being prominent in the 1970s and 80s, tapering off in the 1990s and 2000s, and starting to rise again since the late 2010s. Alongside this revival, we observe a steady rise in dataset and methodological contributions since the 1990s, such that today, on average, individual NLP papers contribute in more ways than ever before. Our dataset and analyses offer a powerful lens for tracing research trends and offer potential for generating informed, data-driven literature surveys.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19505v2

Follow-up Question Generation For Enhanced Patient-Provider Conversations,"['Joseph Gatto', 'Parker Seegmiller', 'Timothy E. Burdick', 'Inas S. Khayal', 'Sarah DeLozier', 'Sarah Masud Preum']","Follow-up question generation is an essential feature of dialogue systems as it can reduce conversational ambiguity and enhance modeling complex interactions. Conversational contexts often pose core NLP challenges such as (i) extracting relevant information buried in fragmented data sources, and (ii) modeling parallel thought processes. These two challenges occur frequently in medical dialogue as a doctor asks questions based not only on patient utterances but also their prior EHR data and current diagnostic hypotheses. Asking medical questions in asynchronous conversations compounds these issues as doctors can only rely on static EHR information to motivate follow-up questions. To address these challenges, we introduce FollowupQ, a novel framework for enhancing asynchronous medical conversation. FollowupQ is a multi-agent framework that processes patient messages and EHR data to generate personalized follow-up questions, clarifying patient-reported medical conditions. FollowupQ reduces requisite provider follow-up communications by 34%. It also improves performance by 17% and 5% on real and synthetic data, respectively. We also release the first public dataset of asynchronous medical messages with linked EHR data alongside 2,300 follow-up questions written by clinical experts for the wider NLP research community.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17509v1
Unveiling Privacy Risks in LLM Agent Memory,"['Bo Wang', 'Weiyi He', 'Shenglai Zeng', 'Zhen Xiang', 'Yue Xing', 'Jiliang Tang', 'Pengfei He']","Large Language Model (LLM) agents have become increasingly prevalent across various real-world applications. They enhance decision-making by storing private user-agent interactions in the memory module for demonstrations, introducing new privacy risks for LLM agents. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerability of LLM agents to our proposed Memory EXTRaction Attack (MEXTRA) under a black-box setting. To extract private information from memory, we propose an effective attacking prompt design and an automated prompt generation method based on different levels of knowledge about the LLM agent. Experiments on two representative agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MEXTRA. Moreover, we explore key factors influencing memory leakage from both the agent designer's and the attacker's perspectives.

Watching the Watchers: Exposing Gender Disparities in Machine Translation Quality Estimation,"['Emmanouil Zaranis', 'Giuseppe Attanasio', 'Sweta Agrawal', 'Andre Martins']","Quality estimation (QE)-the automatic assessment of translation quality-has recently become crucial across several stages of the translation pipeline, from data curation to training and decoding. While QE metrics have been optimized to align with human judgments, whether they encode social biases has been largely overlooked. Biased QE risks favoring certain demographic groups over others, e.g., by exacerbating gaps in visibility and usability. This paper defines and investigates gender bias of QE metrics and discusses its downstream implications for machine translation (MT). Experiments with state-of-the-art QE metrics across multiple domains, datasets, and languages reveal significant bias. When a human entity's gender in the source is undisclosed, masculine-inflected translations score higher than feminine-inflected ones, and gender-neutral translations are penalized. Even when contextual cues disambiguate gender, using context-aware QE metrics leads to more errors in selecting the correct translation inflection for feminine referents than for masculine ones. Moreover, a biased QE metric affects data filtering and quality-aware decoding. Our findings underscore the need for a renewed focus on developing and evaluating QE metrics centered on gender.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10995v4

Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 15 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research. We hope PRMBench can be a robust bench for advancing research on PRM evaluation and development.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03124v5
Efficient Ensemble for Fine-tuning Language Models on Multiple Datasets,"['Dongyue Li', 'Ziniu Zhang', 'Lu Wang', 'Hongyang R. Zhang']","This paper develops an ensemble method for fine-tuning a language model to multiple datasets. Existing methods, such as quantized LoRA (QLoRA), are efficient when adapting to a single dataset. When training on multiple datasets of different tasks, a common setup in practice, it remains unclear how to design an efficient adaptation for fine-tuning language models. We propose to use an ensemble of multiple smaller adapters instead of a single adapter per task. We design an efficient algorithm that partitions $n$ datasets into $m$ groups, where $m$ is typically much smaller than $n$ in practice, and train one adapter for each group before taking a weighted combination to form the ensemble. The algorithm leverages a first-order approximation property of low-rank adaptation to quickly obtain the fine-tuning performances of dataset combinations since methods like LoRA stay close to the base model. Hence, we use the gradients of the base model to estimate its behavior during fine-tuning. Empirically, this approximation holds with less than $1\%$ error on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, leading to an estimation of true fine-tuning performances under $5\%$ error while speeding up computation compared to base fine-tuning by $105$ times. When applied to fine-tune Llama and GPT models on ten text classification tasks, our approach provides up to $10\%$ higher average test accuracy over QLoRA, with only $9\%$ more FLOPs. On a Llama model with $34$ billion parameters, an ensemble of QLoRA increases test accuracy by $3\%$ compared to QLoRA, with only $8\%$ more FLOPs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21930v1

Yet, there is still insufficient understanding of how jailbreaking works, which makes it hard to develop effective defense strategies. We aim to shed more light into this issue: we conduct a detailed large-scale analysis of seven different jailbreak methods and find that these disagreements stem from insufficient observation samples. In particular, we introduce \textit{safety boundary}, and we find that jailbreaks shift harmful activations outside that safety boundary, where LLMs are less sensitive to harmful information. We also find that the low and the middle layers are critical in such shifts, while deeper layers have less impact. Leveraging on these insights, we propose a novel defense called \textbf{Activation Boundary Defense} (ABD), which adaptively constrains the activations within the safety boundary. We further use Bayesian optimization to selectively apply the defense method to the low and the middle layers. Our experiments on several benchmarks show that ABD achieves an average DSR of over 98\% against various forms of jailbreak attacks, with less than 2\% impact on the model's general capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17034v2

Improving Automatic Evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Biomedical Relation Extraction via LLMs-as-the-Judge,"['Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar', 'Israt Jahan', 'Elham Dolatabadi', 'Chun Peng', 'Enamul Hoque', 'Jimmy Huang']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in biomedical relation extraction, even in zero-shot scenarios. However, evaluating LLMs in this task remains challenging due to their ability to generate human-like text, often producing synonyms or abbreviations of gold-standard answers, making traditional automatic evaluation metrics unreliable. On the other hand, while human evaluation is more reliable, it is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications. This paper investigates the use of LLMs-as-the-Judge as an alternative evaluation method for biomedical relation extraction. We benchmark 8 LLMs as judges to evaluate the responses generated by 5 other LLMs across 3 biomedical relation extraction datasets. Unlike other text-generation tasks, we observe that LLM-based judges perform quite poorly (usually below 50% accuracy) in the biomedical relation extraction task. Our findings reveal that it happens mainly because relations extracted by LLMs do not adhere to any standard format. To address this, we propose structured output formatting for LLM-generated responses that helps LLM-Judges to improve their performance by about 15% (on average). We also introduce a domain adaptation technique to further enhance LLM-Judge performance by effectively transferring knowledge between datasets. We release both our human-annotated and LLM-annotated judgment data (36k samples in total) for public use here: https://github.com/tahmedge/llm_judge_biomedical_re.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00777v1

Efficient Knowledge Editing via Minimal Precomputation,"['Akshat Gupta', 'Maochuan Lu', 'Thomas Hartvigsen', 'Gopala Anumanchipalli']","Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute efficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update facts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a ""precomputation step"", which requires a one-time but significant computational cost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million hidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million tokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single GPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this precomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this excessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and related methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a very small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the theoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for solutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that knowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing significantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the precomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally stipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of precomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few minutes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04226v1

Existing defense mechanisms have not fully deleted harmful knowledge in LLMs, which allows such attacks to bypass safeguards and produce harmful outputs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel safety alignment strategy, Constrained Knowledge Unlearning (CKU), which focuses on two primary objectives: knowledge localization and retention, and unlearning harmful knowledge. CKU works by scoring neurons in specific multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers to identify a subset U of neurons associated with useful knowledge. During the unlearning process, CKU prunes the gradients of neurons in U to preserve valuable knowledge while effectively mitigating harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that CKU significantly enhances model safety without compromising overall performance, offering a superior balance between safety and utility compared to existing methods. Additionally, our analysis of neuron knowledge sensitivity across various MLP layers provides valuable insights into the mechanics of safety alignment and model knowledge editing.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18588v1

Pre-Training Curriculum for Multi-Token Prediction in Language Models,"['Ansar Aynetdinov', 'Alan Akbik']","Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22757v1
Can We Further Elicit Reasoning in LLMs? Critic-Guided Planning with Retrieval-Augmentation for Solving Challenging Tasks,"['Xingxuan Li', 'Weiwen Xu', 'Ruochen Zhao', 'Fangkai Jiao', 'Shafiq Joty', 'Lidong Bing']","State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive problem-solving capabilities but may struggle with complex reasoning and factual correctness. Existing methods harness the strengths of chain-of-thought and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to decompose a complex problem into simpler steps and apply retrieval to improve factual correctness. These methods work well on straightforward reasoning tasks but often falter on challenging tasks such as competitive programming and mathematics, due to frequent reasoning errors and irrelevant knowledge retrieval. To address this, we introduce Critic-guided planning with Retrieval-augmentation, CR-Planner, a novel framework that leverages fine-tuned critic models to guide both reasoning and retrieval processes through planning. CR-Planner solves a problem by iteratively selecting and executing sub-goals. Initially, it identifies the most promising sub-goal from reasoning, query generation, and retrieval, guided by rewards given by a critic model named sub-goal critic. It then executes this sub-goal through sampling and selecting the optimal output based on evaluations from another critic model named execution critic. This iterative process, informed by retrieved information and critic models, enables CR-Planner to effectively navigate the solution space towards the final answer. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to collect the data for training the critic models, allowing for a systematic exploration of action sequences and their long-term impacts. We validate CR-Planner on challenging domain-knowledge-intensive and reasoning-heavy tasks, including competitive programming, theorem-driven math reasoning, and complex domain retrieval problems. Our experiments demonstrate that CR-Planner significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing challenging problems by improving both reasoning and retrieval.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01428v1
On Many-Shot In-Context Learning for Long-Context Evaluation,"['Kaijian Zou', 'Muhammad Khalifa', 'Lu Wang']","Many-shot in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a unique setup to both utilize and test the ability of large language models to handle long context. This paper delves into long-context language model (LCLM) evaluation through many-shot ICL. We first ask: what types of ICL tasks benefit from additional demonstrations, and how effective are they in evaluating LCLMs? We find that classification and summarization tasks show performance improvements with additional demonstrations, while translation and reasoning tasks do not exhibit clear trends. Next, we investigate the extent to which different tasks necessitate retrieval versus global context understanding. We develop metrics to categorize ICL tasks into two groups: (i) similar-sample learning (SSL): tasks where retrieval of the most similar examples is sufficient for good performance, and (ii) all-sample learning (ASL): tasks that necessitate a deeper comprehension of all examples in the prompt. Lastly, we introduce a new many-shot ICL benchmark, MANYICLBENCH, to characterize model's ability on both fronts and benchmark 12 LCLMs using MANYICLBENCH. We find that while state-of-the-art models demonstrate good performance up to 64k tokens in SSL tasks, many models experience significant performance drops at only 16k tokens in ASL tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07130v3

Balancing the Budget: Understanding Trade-offs Between Supervised and Preference-Based Finetuning,"['Mohit Raghavendra', 'Junmo Kang', 'Alan Ritter']","Post-training of Large Language Models often involves a pipeline of Supervised Finetuning (SFT) followed by Preference Finetuning (PFT) using methods like Direct Preference Optimization. Both stages require annotated data that are very different in structure and costs. We study how to optimally allocate a fixed training data budget between the two stages, through extensive experiments spanning four diverse tasks, multiple model sizes and various data annotation costs. Our findings reveal that just SFT on the base model dominates performance in low-data regimes ($<1,000$ annotated examples). With larger data-budgets, we observe that a combination of SFT and PFT, often with increasing portions allocated towards preference data yields optimal performance. However, completely eliminating SFT and running PFT directly on the base model yields suboptimal performance, described as the cold start problem on tasks like mathematics. We observe that this is due to the distribution shift arising from using DPO directly on the base model to elicit step-by-step reasoning. This limitation can be effectively addressed by allocating even a small portion ($<10$%) of the budget to SFT first, resulting in performance improvements of $15-20$% on analytical benchmarks like GSM8k. These results provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners optimizing model development under budget constraints, where high-quality data curation often represents a significant portion of the total costs of model development.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11284v1
All That Glitters is Not Novel: Plagiarism in AI Generated Research,"['Tarun Gupta', 'Danish Pruthi']","Automating scientific research is considered the final frontier of science. Recently, several papers claim autonomous research agents can generate novel research ideas. Amidst the prevailing optimism, we document a critical concern: a considerable fraction of such research documents are smartly plagiarized. Unlike past efforts where experts evaluate the novelty and feasibility of research ideas, we request $13$ experts to operate under a different situational logic: to identify similarities between LLM-generated research documents and existing work. Concerningly, the experts identify $24\%$ of the $50$ evaluated research documents to be either paraphrased (with one-to-one methodological mapping), or significantly borrowed from existing work. These reported instances are cross-verified by authors of the source papers. Experts find an additional $32\%$ ideas to partially overlap with prior work, and a small fraction to be completely original. Problematically, these LLM-generated research documents do not acknowledge original sources, and bypass inbuilt plagiarism detectors. Lastly, through controlled experiments we show that automated plagiarism detectors are inadequate at catching plagiarized ideas from such systems. We recommend a careful assessment of LLM-generated research, and discuss the implications of our findings on academic publishing.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16487v2

To address these challenges, we propose the concept of Adaptive Imitation and present a novel Recurrent Plan-then-Adapt (RePA) framework. RePA leverages large language models (LLMs) for effective adaptive imitation through a fine-grained plan-then-adapt process. RePA also enables recurrent segment-by-segment imitation, supported by two memory structures that enhance input clarity and output coherence.

This 'under-representation' has motivated recent cross-lingual transfer methods to leverage the English representation space by e.g. mixing English and 'non-English' tokens at the input level or extending model parameters to accommodate new languages. However, these approaches often come at the cost of increased computational complexity. We propose Fusion forLanguage Representations (FLARE) in adapters, a novel method that enhances representation quality and downstream performance for languages other than English while maintaining parameter efficiency. FLARE integrates source and target language representations within low-rank (LoRA) adapters using lightweight linear transformations, maintaining parameter efficiency while improving transfer performance. A series of experiments across representative cross-lingual natural language understanding tasks, including natural language inference, question-answering and sentiment analysis, demonstrate FLARE's effectiveness.

Culture is Not Trivia: Sociocultural Theory for Cultural NLP,"['Naitian Zhou', 'David Bamman', 'Isaac L. Bleaman']","The field of cultural NLP has recently experienced rapid growth, driven by a pressing need to ensure that language technologies are effective and safe across a pluralistic user base. This work has largely progressed without a shared conception of culture, instead choosing to rely on a wide array of cultural proxies. However, this leads to a number of recurring limitations: coarse national boundaries fail to capture nuanced differences that lay within them, limited coverage restricts datasets to only a subset of usually highly-represented cultures, and a lack of dynamicity results in static cultural benchmarks that do not change as culture evolves. In this position paper, we argue that these methodological limitations are symptomatic of a theoretical gap. We draw on a well-developed theory of culture from sociocultural linguistics to fill this gap by 1) demonstrating in a case study how it can clarify methodological constraints and affordances, 2) offering theoretically-motivated paths forward to achieving cultural competence, and 3) arguing that localization is a more useful framing for the goals of much current work in cultural NLP.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12057v1

How to intervene on such system outputs to mitigate anthropomorphic behaviors and their attendant harmful outcomes, however, remains understudied. With this work, we aim to provide empirical and theoretical grounding for developing such interventions. To do so, we compile an inventory of interventions grounded both in prior literature and a crowdsourcing study where participants edited system outputs to make them less human-like. Drawing on this inventory, we also develop a conceptual framework to help characterize the landscape of possible interventions, articulate distinctions between different types of interventions, and provide a theoretical basis for evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14019v2
Evaluating Multimodal Language Models as Visual Assistants for Visually Impaired Users,"['Antonia Karamolegkou', 'Malvina Nikandrou', 'Georgios Pantazopoulos', 'Danae Sanchez Villegas', 'Phillip Rust', 'Ruchira Dhar', 'Daniel Hershcovich', 'Anders Søgaard']","This paper explores the effectiveness of Multimodal Large Language models (MLLMs) as assistive technologies for visually impaired individuals. We conduct a user survey to identify adoption patterns and key challenges users face with such technologies. Despite a high adoption rate of these models, our findings highlight concerns related to contextual understanding, cultural sensitivity, and complex scene understanding, particularly for individuals who may rely solely on them for visual interpretation. Informed by these results, we collate five user-centred tasks with image and video inputs, including a novel task on Optical Braille Recognition. Our systematic evaluation of twelve MLLMs reveals that further advancements are necessary to overcome limitations related to cultural context, multilingual support, Braille reading comprehension, assistive object recognition, and hallucinations.

HumT DumT: Measuring and controlling human-like language in LLMs,"['Myra Cheng', 'Sunny Yu', 'Dan Jurafsky']","Should LLMs generate language that makes them seem human? Human-like language might improve user experience, but might also lead to deception, overreliance, and stereotyping. Assessing these potential impacts requires a systematic way to measure human-like tone in LLM outputs. We introduce HumT and SocioT, metrics for human-like tone and other dimensions of social perceptions in text data based on relative probabilities from an LLM. By measuring HumT across preference and usage datasets, we find that users prefer less human-like outputs from LLMs in many contexts. HumT also offers insights into the perceptions and impacts of anthropomorphism: human-like LLM outputs are highly correlated with warmth, social closeness, femininity, and low status, which are closely linked to the aforementioned harms. We introduce DumT, a method using HumT to systematically control and reduce the degree of human-like tone while preserving model performance. DumT offers a practical approach for mitigating risks associated with anthropomorphic language generation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13259v2
ChatBench: From Static Benchmarks to Human-AI Evaluation,"['Serina Chang', 'Ashton Anderson', 'Jake M. Hofman']","With the rapid adoption of LLM-based chatbots, there is a pressing need to evaluate what humans and LLMs can achieve together. However, standard benchmarks, such as MMLU, measure LLM capabilities in isolation (i.e., ""AI-alone""). Here, we design and conduct a user study to convert MMLU questions into user-AI conversations, by seeding the user with the question and having them carry out a conversation with the LLM to answer their question. We release ChatBench, a new dataset with AI-alone, user-alone, and user-AI data for 396 questions and two LLMs, including 144K answers and 7,336 user-AI conversations. We find that AI-alone accuracy fails to predict user-AI accuracy, with significant differences across multiple subjects (math, physics, and moral reasoning), and we analyze the user-AI conversations to provide insight into how they diverge from AI-alone benchmarks. Finally, we show that fine-tuning a user simulator on a subset of ChatBench improves its ability to estimate user-AI accuracies, increasing correlation on held-out questions by more than 20 points, creating possibilities for scaling interactive evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07114v1

Teaching an Old LLM Secure Coding: Localized Preference Optimization on Distilled Preferences,"['Mohammad Saqib Hasan', 'Saikat Chakraborty', 'Santu Karmaker', 'Niranjan Balasubramanian']","LLM generated code often contains security issues. We address two key challenges in improving secure code generation. First, obtaining high quality training data covering a broad set of security issues is critical. To address this, we introduce a method for distilling a preference dataset of insecure and secure code pairs from frontier LLMs, along with a security reasoning that explains the issues and the fix. The key idea here is to make use of security knowledge sources to devise a systematic prompting strategy that ensures broad coverage. Second, aligning models to secure code requires focusing on localized regions of code. Direct preference optimization methods, like SimPO, are not designed to handle these localized differences and turn out to be ineffective. We address this with a new localized preference optimization algorithm that masks the security related tokens in both the winning (secure) and losing (insecure) responses. To prevent loss in code quality, we also add a regularizer. Evaluations show that both training on our dataset, DiSCo, and the new preference optimization algorithm, LPO, yield substantial reductions in code insecurity while also improving overall code quality.

Anything Goes? A Crosslinguistic Study of (Im)possible Language Learning in LMs,"['Xiulin Yang', 'Tatsuya Aoyama', 'Yuekun Yao', 'Ethan Wilcox']","Do language models (LMs) offer insights into human language learning? A common argument against this idea is that because their architecture and training paradigm are so vastly different from humans, LMs can learn arbitrary inputs as easily as natural languages. We test this claim by training LMs to model impossible and typologically unattested languages. Unlike previous work, which has focused exclusively on English, we conduct experiments on 12 languages from 4 language families with two newly constructed parallel corpora. Our results show that while GPT-2 small can largely distinguish attested languages from their impossible counterparts, it does not achieve perfect separation between all the attested languages and all the impossible ones. We further test whether GPT-2 small distinguishes typologically attested from unattested languages with different NP orders by manipulating word order based on Greenberg's Universal 20. We find that the model's perplexity scores do not distinguish attested vs. unattested word orders, while its performance on the generalization test does. These findings suggest that LMs exhibit some human-like inductive biases, though these biases are weaker than those found in human learners.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18795v2
Ranking Unraveled: Recipes for LLM Rankings in Head-to-Head AI Combat,"['Roland Daynauth', 'Christopher Clarke', 'Krisztian Flautner', 'Lingjia Tang', 'Jason Mars']","Deciding which large language model (LLM) to use is a complex challenge. Pairwise ranking has emerged as a new method for evaluating human preferences for LLMs. This approach entails humans evaluating pairs of model outputs based on a predefined criterion. By collecting these comparisons, a ranking can be constructed using methods such as Elo. However, applying these algorithms as constructed in the context of LLM evaluation introduces several challenges. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of ranking systems for head-to-head comparisons of LLMs. We formally define a set of fundamental principles for effective ranking and conduct a series of extensive evaluations on the robustness of several ranking algorithms in the context of LLMs. Our analysis uncovers key insights into the factors that affect ranking accuracy and efficiency, offering guidelines for selecting the most appropriate methods based on specific evaluation contexts and resource constraints.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14483v2
LLM Agents Making Agent Tools,"['Georg Wölflein', 'Dyke Ferber', 'Daniel Truhn', 'Ognjen Arandjelovic', 'Jakob Nikolas Kather']","Tool use has turned large language models (LLMs) into powerful agents that can perform complex multi-step tasks by dynamically utilising external software components. However, these tools must be implemented in advance by human developers, hindering the applicability of LLM agents in domains demanding large numbers of highly specialised tools, like in life sciences and medicine. Motivated by the growing trend of scientific studies accompanied by public code repositories, we propose ToolMaker, an agentic framework that autonomously transforms papers with code into LLM-compatible tools. Given a GitHub URL and short task description, ToolMaker autonomously installs dependencies and generates code to perform the task, using a closed-loop self-correction mechanism for debugging. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark comprising 15 complex computational tasks spanning various domains with over 100 unit tests to assess correctness and robustness. Our method correctly implements 80% of the tasks, substantially outperforming current state-of-the-art software engineering agents. ToolMaker therefore is a step towards fully autonomous agent-based scientific workflows.

But event reasoning remains a difficult challenge, and despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to accurately identify causal connections between events. This struggle leads to poor performance on deeper reasoning tasks like event forecasting and timeline understanding. To address this challenge, we investigate the generation of causal event graphs (e.g., A enables B) as a parallel mechanism to help LLMs explicitly represent causality during inference. This paper evaluates both how to generate correct graphs as well as how graphs can assist reasoning. We propose a collaborative approach to causal graph generation where we use LLMs to simulate experts that focus on specific semantic relations. The experts engage in multiple rounds of discussions which are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate the utility of causal graphs, we use them on multiple downstream applications, and also introduce a new explainable event prediction task that requires a causal chain of events in the explanation. These explanations are more informative and coherent than baseline generations. Finally, our overall approach not finetuned on any downstream task, achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art models on both forecasting and next event prediction tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06910v1

Cultural Bias Matters: A Cross-Cultural Benchmark Dataset and Sentiment-Enriched Model for Understanding Multimodal Metaphors,"['Senqi Yang', 'Dongyu Zhang', 'Jing Ren', 'Ziqi Xu', 'Xiuzhen Zhang', 'Yiliao Song', 'Hongfei Lin', 'Feng Xia']","Metaphors are pervasive in communication, making them crucial for natural language processing (NLP). Previous research on automatic metaphor processing predominantly relies on training data consisting of English samples, which often reflect Western European or North American biases. This cultural skew can lead to an overestimation of model performance and contributions to NLP progress. However, the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing, particularly in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MultiMM, a Multicultural Multimodal Metaphor dataset designed for cross-cultural studies of metaphor in Chinese and English. MultiMM consists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by fine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal metaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates sentiment embeddings to enhance metaphor comprehension across cultural backgrounds. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of SEMD on metaphor detection and sentiment analysis tasks. We hope this work increases awareness of cultural bias in NLP research and contributes to the development of fairer and more inclusive language models.

However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic speech response (135K).

Mixtures of In-Context Learners,"['Giwon Hong', 'Emile van Krieken', 'Edoardo Ponti', 'Nikolay Malkin', 'Pasquale Minervini']","In-context learning (ICL) adapts LLMs by providing demonstrations without fine-tuning the model parameters; however, it does not differentiate between demonstrations and quadratically increases the complexity of Transformer LLMs, exhausting the memory. As a solution, we propose Mixtures of In-Context Learners (MoICL), a novel approach to treat subsets of demonstrations as experts and learn a weighting function to merge their output distributions based on a training set. In our experiments, we show performance improvements on 5 out of 7 classification datasets compared to a set of strong baselines (up to +13\% compared to ICL and LENS). Moreover, we enhance the Pareto frontier of ICL by reducing the inference time needed to achieve the same performance with fewer demonstrations. Finally, MoICL is more robust to out-of-domain (up to +11\%), imbalanced (up to +49\%), or noisy demonstrations (up to +38\%) or can filter these out from datasets. Overall, MoICL is a more expressive approach to learning from demonstrations without exhausting the context window or memory.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02830v1
Balancing Diversity and Risk in LLM Sampling: How to Select Your Method and Parameter for Open-Ended Text Generation,"['Yuxuan Zhou', 'Margret Keuper', 'Mario Fritz']","Sampling-based decoding strategies have been widely adopted for Large Language Models (LLMs) in numerous applications, targeting a balance between diversity and quality via temperature tuning and tail truncation. Considering the strong dependency of the candidate next tokens on different prefixes, recent studies propose to adaptively truncate the tail of LLMs' predicted distribution. Although improved results have been reported with these methods on open-ended text generation tasks, the results are highly dependent on the curated parameters and the limited exemplar text. In this paper, we propose a systematic way to estimate the capacity of a truncation sampling method by considering the trade-off between diversity and risk at each decoding step, based on our collected prefix tree which preserves the context of a full sentence. Our work offers a comprehensive comparison of existing truncation sampling methods and serves as a practical user guideline for their parameter selection.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13586v2

Previous approaches have attempted to utilize multimodal LLMs for this task, enhancing their performance through the integration of domain-specific knowledge retrieval. However, these approaches often overlook the knowledge already embedded within the LLMs, leading to redundant information integration. To address this limitation, we propose Radar, a framework for enhancing radiology report generation with supplementary knowledge injection. Radar improves report generation by systematically leveraging both the internal knowledge of an LLM and externally retrieved information. Specifically, it first extracts the model's acquired knowledge that aligns with expert image-based classification outputs. It then retrieves relevant supplementary knowledge to further enrich this information. Finally, by aggregating both sources, Radar generates more accurate and informative radiology reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert-Plus, and IU X-ray demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs in both language quality and clinical accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14318v2

To improve zero-shot methods, we propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and sample diversity.

Attention Speaks Volumes: Localizing and Mitigating Bias in Language Models,"['Rishabh Adiga', 'Besmira Nushi', 'Varun Chandrasekaran']","We explore the internal mechanisms of how bias emerges in large language models (LLMs) when provided with ambiguous comparative prompts: inputs that compare or enforce choosing between two or more entities without providing clear context for preference. Most approaches for bias mitigation focus on either post-hoc analysis or data augmentation. However, these are transient solutions, without addressing the root cause: the model itself. Numerous prior works show the influence of the attention module towards steering generations. We believe that analyzing attention is also crucial for understanding bias, as it provides insight into how the LLM distributes its focus across different entities and how this contributes to biased decisions. To this end, we first introduce a metric to quantify the LLM's preference for one entity over another. We then propose $\texttt{ATLAS}$ (Attention-based Targeted Layer Analysis and Scaling), a technique to localize bias to specific layers of the LLM by analyzing attention scores and then reduce bias by scaling attention in these biased layers. To evaluate our method, we conduct experiments across 3 datasets (BBQ, Crows-Pairs, and WinoGender) using $\texttt{GPT-2 XL}$ (1.5B), $\texttt{GPT-J}$ (6B), $\texttt{LLaMA-2}$ (7B) and $\texttt{LLaMA-3}$ (8B). Our experiments demonstrate that bias is concentrated in the later layers, typically around the last third. We also show how $\texttt{ATLAS}$ effectively mitigates bias through targeted interventions without compromising downstream performance and an average increase of only 0.82% in perplexity when the intervention is applied. We see an average improvement of 0.28 points in the bias score across all the datasets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22517v1

By integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) as efficient retrieval mechanisms, we are able to significantly reduce data retrieval times while maintaining high model performance. The early exit strategy employed allows for dynamic termination of model inference, utilizing real-time predictive confidence assessments across multiple heads. This not only quickens the responsiveness of LLMs but also upholds or improves their accuracy, making it ideal for real-time application scenarios.

Unraveling LoRA Interference: Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust Model Merging,"['Haobo Zhang', 'Jiayu Zhou']","Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) for individual tasks yields strong performance but is expensive for deployment and storage. Recent works explore model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data distributions. We propose Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust model Merging (OSRM) to constrain the LoRA subspace *prior* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others. Our approach can seamlessly integrate with most existing merging algorithms, reducing the unintended interference among tasks. Extensive experiments on eight datasets, tested with three widely used LMs and two large LMs, demonstrate that our method not only boosts merging performance but also preserves single-task accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness to the hyperparameters of merging.

In contrast, inductive reasoning, where one infers the underlying rules from observed data, remains less explored. Such inductive processes lie at the heart of scientific discovery, as they enable researchers to extract general principles from empirical observations. To assess whether LLMs possess this capacity, we introduce InductionBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs. Our experimental findings reveal that even the most advanced models available struggle to master the simplest complexity classes within the subregular hierarchy of functions, highlighting a notable deficiency in current LLMs' inductive reasoning capabilities.

Particularly, we build heuristic human feedback with reinforcement learning to ensure the consistency of the generated image with the source sentence without the supervision of image annotation, which breaks the bottleneck of using visual information in MT. Furthermore, the proposed method enables imaginative visual information to be integrated into large-scale text-only MT in addition to multimodal MT.

Who Writes What: Unveiling the Impact of Author Roles on AI-generated Text Detection,"['Jiatao Li', 'Xiaojun Wan']","The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates accurate AI-generated text detection. However, current approaches largely overlook the influence of author characteristics. We investigate how sociolinguistic attributes-gender, CEFR proficiency, academic field, and language environment-impact state-of-the-art AI text detectors. Using the ICNALE corpus of human-authored texts and parallel AI-generated texts from diverse LLMs, we conduct a rigorous evaluation employing multi-factor ANOVA and weighted least squares (WLS). Our results reveal significant biases: CEFR proficiency and language environment consistently affected detector accuracy, while gender and academic field showed detector-dependent effects. These findings highlight the crucial need for socially aware AI text detection to avoid unfairly penalizing specific demographic groups. We offer novel empirical evidence, a robust statistical framework, and actionable insights for developing more equitable and reliable detection systems in real-world, out-of-domain contexts. This work paves the way for future research on bias mitigation, inclusive evaluation benchmarks, and socially responsible LLM detectors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12611v1
RoCoFT: Efficient Finetuning of Large Language Models with Row-Column Updates,"['Md Kowsher', 'Tara Esmaeilbeig', 'Chun-Nam Yu', 'Chen Chen', 'Mojtaba Soltanalian', 'Niloofar Yousefi']","We propose RoCoFT, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for large-scale language models (LMs) based on updating only a few rows and columns of the weight matrices in transformers. Through extensive experiments with medium-size LMs like BERT and RoBERTa, and larger LMs like Bloom-7B, Llama2-7B, and Llama2-13B, we show that our method gives comparable or better accuracies than state-of-art PEFT methods while also being more memory and computation-efficient. We also study the reason behind the effectiveness of our method with tools from neural tangent kernel theory. We empirically demonstrate that our kernel, constructed using a restricted set of row and column parameters, are numerically close to the full-parameter kernel and gives comparable classification performance. Ablation studies are conducted to investigate the impact of different algorithmic choices, including the selection strategy for rows and columns as well as the optimal rank for effective implementation of our method.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10075v3

Despite its cultural and linguistic significance, there has been limited progress in developing a comprehensive corpus to capture these variations for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present Unggah-Ungguh, a carefully curated dataset designed to encapsulate the nuances of Unggah-Ungguh Basa, the Javanese speech etiquette framework that dictates the choice of words and phrases based on social hierarchy and context. Using Unggah-Ungguh, we assess the ability of language models (LMs) to process various levels of Javanese honorifics through classification and machine translation tasks. To further evaluate cross-lingual LMs, we conduct machine translation experiments between Javanese (at specific honorific levels) and Indonesian. Additionally, we explore whether LMs can generate contextually appropriate Javanese honorifics in conversation tasks, where the honorific usage should align with the social role and contextual cues. Our findings indicate that current LMs struggle with most honorific levels, exhibitinga bias toward certain honorific tiers.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20864v2

However, most datasets, including the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus, consist entirely of free-form reports, which are inherently variable and unstructured. This variability poses challenges for both generation and evaluation: existing models struggle to produce consistent, clinically meaningful reports, and standard evaluation metrics fail to capture the nuances of radiological interpretation. To address this, we introduce Structured Radiology Report Generation (SRRG), a new task that reformulates free-text radiology reports into a standardized format, ensuring clarity, consistency, and structured clinical reporting. We create a novel dataset by restructuring reports using large language models (LLMs) following strict structured reporting desiderata. Additionally, we introduce SRR-BERT, a fine-grained disease classification model trained on 55 labels, enabling more precise and clinically informed evaluation of structured reports. To assess report quality, we propose F1-SRR-BERT, a metric that leverages SRR-BERT's hierarchical disease taxonomy to bridge the gap between free-text variability and structured clinical reporting.

LPOI: Listwise Preference Optimization for Vision Language Models,"['Fatemeh Pesaran zadeh', 'Yoojin Oh', 'Gunhee Kim']","Aligning large VLMs with human preferences is a challenging task, as methods like RLHF and DPO often overfit to textual information or exacerbate hallucinations. Although augmenting negative image samples partially addresses these pitfalls, no prior work has employed listwise preference optimization for VLMs, due to the complexity and cost of constructing listwise image samples. In this work, we propose LPOI, the first object-aware listwise preference optimization developed for reducing hallucinations in VLMs. LPOI identifies and masks a critical object in the image, and then interpolates the masked region between the positive and negative images to form a sequence of incrementally more complete images. The model is trained to rank these images in ascending order of object visibility, effectively reducing hallucinations while retaining visual fidelity. LPOI requires no extra annotations beyond standard pairwise preference data, as it automatically constructs the ranked lists through object masking and interpolation. Comprehensive experiments on MMHalBench, AMBER, and Object HalBench confirm that LPOI outperforms existing preference optimization methods in reducing hallucinations and enhancing VLM performance.

Effective triage systems, like those in emergency rooms, could ensure proper prioritization of open cases, optimizing time and resource allocation in the court system. In this work, we introduce the Criticality Prediction dataset, a novel resource for evaluating case prioritization. Our dataset features a two-tier labeling system: (1) the binary LD-Label, identifying cases published as Leading Decisions (LD), and (2) the more granular Citation-Label, ranking cases by their citation frequency and recency, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation. Unlike existing approaches that rely on resource-intensive manual annotations, we algorithmically derive labels leading to a much larger dataset than otherwise possible. We evaluate several multilingual models, including both smaller fine-tuned models and large language models in a zero-shot setting. Our results show that the fine-tuned models consistently outperform their larger counterparts, thanks to our large training set.

Is linguistically-motivated data augmentation worth it?,"['Ray Groshan', 'Michael Ginn', 'Alexis Palmer']","Data augmentation, a widely-employed technique for addressing data scarcity, involves generating synthetic data examples which are then used to augment available training data. Researchers have seen surprising success from simple methods, such as random perturbations from natural examples, where models seem to benefit even from data with nonsense words, or data that doesn't conform to the rules of the language. A second line of research produces synthetic data that does in fact follow all linguistic constraints; these methods require some linguistic expertise and are generally more challenging to implement. No previous work has done a systematic, empirical comparison of both linguistically-naive and linguistically-motivated data augmentation strategies, leaving uncertainty about whether the additional time and effort of linguistically-motivated data augmentation work in fact yields better downstream performance. In this work, we conduct a careful and comprehensive comparison of augmentation strategies (both linguistically-naive and linguistically-motivated) for two low-resource languages with different morphological properties, Uspanteko and Arapaho. We evaluate the effectiveness of many different strategies and their combinations across two important sequence-to-sequence tasks for low-resource languages: machine translation and interlinear glossing. We find that linguistically-motivated strategies can have benefits over naive approaches, but only when the new examples they produce are not significantly unlike the training data distribution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03593v1
From Lists to Emojis: How Format Bias Affects Model Alignment,"['Xuanchang Zhang', 'Wei Xiong', 'Lichang Chen', 'Tianyi Zhou', 'Heng Huang', 'Tong Zhang']","In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including human evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark, exhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links, bold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit these biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval and LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where current preference models favor longer responses that appear more comprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter, competing responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely underexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in preference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a comprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show that with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject significant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also be easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n sampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the format than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the need to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms and evaluating models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11704v2

To enable reliable and comprehensive evaluation, we created CoAM: Corpus of All-Type Multiword Expressions, a dataset of 1.3K sentences constructed through a multi-step process to enhance data quality consisting of human annotation, human review, and automated consistency checking. Additionally, for the first time in a dataset of MWE identification, CoAM's MWEs are tagged with MWE types, such as Noun and Verb, enabling fine-grained error analysis.

In order to achieve success in long context tasks, a large amount of work has been done to enhance the long context capabilities of the model through synthetic data. Existing methods typically utilize the Self-Instruct framework to generate instruction tuning data for better long context capability improvement. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that less than 35% of generated samples are multi-hop, and more than 40% exhibit poor quality, limiting comprehensive understanding and further research. To improve the quality of synthetic data, we propose the Multi-agent Interactive Multi-hop Generation (MIMG) framework, incorporating a Quality Verification Agent, a Single-hop Question Generation Agent, a Multiple Question Sampling Strategy, and a Multi-hop Question Merger Agent. This framework improves the data quality, with the proportion of high-quality, multi-hop, and diverse data exceeding 85%.

The one-size-fits-all alignment mechanism undermines LLM's utility for these qualified users. To address this problem, we propose SudoLM, a framework that lets LLMs learn access control over specific parametric knowledge for users with different credentials via authorization alignment. SudoLM allows authorized users to unlock their access to all the parametric knowledge with an assigned SUDO key while blocking access to non-qualified users.

ProgCo: Program Helps Self-Correction of Large Language Models,"['Xiaoshuai Song', 'Yanan Wu', 'Weixun Wang', 'Jiaheng Liu', 'Wenbo Su', 'Bo Zheng']","Self-Correction aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to self-verify and self-refine their initial responses without external feedback.

First, program-driven verification (ProgVe) achieves complex verification logic and extensive validation through self-generated, self-executing verification pseudo-programs. Then, program-driven refinement (ProgRe) receives feedback from ProgVe, conducts dual reflection and refinement on both responses and verification programs to mitigate misleading of incorrect feedback in complex reasoning tasks. Experiments on three instruction-following and mathematical benchmarks indicate that ProgCo achieves effective self-correction, and can be further enhance performance when combined with real program tools.

I0T: Embedding Standardization Method Towards Zero Modality Gap,"['Na Min An', 'Eunki Kim', 'James Thorne', 'Hyunjung Shim']","Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) enables zero-shot inference in downstream tasks such as image-text retrieval and classification. However, recent works extending CLIP suffer from the issue of modality gap, which arises when the image and text embeddings are projected to disparate manifolds, deviating from the intended objective of image-text contrastive learning. We discover that this phenomenon is linked to the modality-specific characteristic that each image/text encoder independently possesses and propose two methods to address the modality gap: (1) a post-hoc embedding standardization method, $\text{I0T}_{\text{post}}$ that reduces the modality gap approximately to zero and (2) a trainable method, $\text{I0T}_{\text{async}}$, to alleviate the modality gap problem by adding two normalization layers for each encoder. Our I0T framework can significantly reduce the modality gap while preserving the original embedding representations of trained models with their locked parameters. In practice, $\text{I0T}_{\text{post}}$ can serve as an alternative explainable automatic evaluation metric of widely used CLIPScore (CLIP-S).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14384v1

Bone Soups: A Seek-and-Soup Model Merging Approach for Controllable Multi-Objective Generation,"['Guofu Xie', 'Xiao Zhang', 'Ting Yao', 'Yunsheng Shi']","User information needs are often highly diverse and varied. A key challenge in current research is how to achieve controllable multi-objective generation while enabling rapid adaptation to accommodate diverse user demands during test time. Existing solutions, such as Rewarded Soup, focus on merging language models individually tuned on single objectives. While easy to implement and widely used, these approaches face limitations in achieving optimal performance due to their disregard for the impacts of competing objectives on model tuning. To address this issue, we propose Bone Soup, a novel model merging approach that first seeks a series of backbone models by considering the impacts of multiple objectives and then makes the soup (i.e., merge the backbone models). Specifically, Bone Soup begins by training multiple backbone models for different objectives using multi-objective reinforcement learning. Each backbone model is guided by a combination of backbone reward signals. To ensure that these models are optimal for the Pareto front, the backbone rewards are crafted by combining standard reward functions into basis vectors, which can then be modified through a rule-based construction method. Bone Soup leverages a symmetric circulant matrix mapping to generate the merging coefficients, which are used to merge the backbone models according to user preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Bone Soup exhibits strong controllability and Pareto optimality in controllable multi-objective generation, providing a more effective and efficient approach to addressing diverse user needs at test time.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10762v2

The synthetic corpora are then used to train synthetic NER models. The results show that training NER models using synthetic corpora incurs only a small drop in predictive performance. The limits of this process are investigated in a systematic ablation study -- using both Swedish and Spanish data.

Just a Scratch: Enhancing LLM Capabilities for Self-harm Detection through Intent Differentiation and Emoji Interpretation,"['Soumitra Ghosh', 'gopendra Vikram singh', 'Shambhavi', 'Sabarna Choudhury', 'Asif Ekbal']","Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle, context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b) fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues, our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm signals.

LLM back generation takes the incomplete cross-domain constituency tree with only domain keyword leaf nodes as input and fills the missing words to generate the cross-domain constituency treebank. Besides, we also introduce a span-level contrastive learning pre-training strategy to make full use of the LLM back generation treebank for cross-domain constituency parsing.

Inconsistent Tokenizations Cause Language Models to be Perplexed by Japanese Grammar,"['Andrew Gambardella', 'Takeshi Kojima', 'Yusuke Iwasawa', 'Yutaka Matsuo']","Typical methods for evaluating the performance of language models evaluate their ability to answer questions accurately. These evaluation metrics are acceptable for determining the extent to which language models can understand and reason about text in a general sense, but fail to capture nuanced capabilities, such as the ability of language models to recognize and obey rare grammar points, particularly in languages other than English. We measure the perplexity of language models when confronted with the ""first person psych predicate restriction"" grammar point in Japanese. Weblab is the only tested open source model in the 7-10B parameter range which consistently assigns higher perplexity to ungrammatical psych predicate sentences than grammatical ones. We give evidence that Weblab's uniformly bad tokenization is a possible root cause for its good performance, and show that Llama 3's perplexity on grammatical psych predicate sentences can be reduced by orders of magnitude (28x difference) by restricting test sentences to those with uniformly well-behaved tokenizations. We show in further experiments on machine translation tasks that language models will use alternative grammar patterns in order to produce grammatical sentences when tokenization issues prevent the most natural sentence from being output.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19599v1
Understanding Impact of Human Feedback via Influence Functions,"['Taywon Min', 'Haeone Lee', 'Yongchan Kwon', 'Kimin Lee']","In Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it is crucial to learn suitable reward models from human feedback to align large language models (LLMs) with human intentions. However, human feedback can often be noisy, inconsistent, or biased, especially when evaluating complex responses. Such feedback can lead to misaligned reward signals, potentially causing unintended side effects during the RLHF process. To address these challenges, we explore the use of influence functions to measure the impact of human feedback on the performance of reward models. We propose a compute-efficient approximation method that enables the application of influence functions to LLM-based reward models and large-scale preference datasets. In our experiments, we demonstrate two key applications of influence functions: (1) detecting common forms of labeler bias in human feedback datasets and (2) guiding labelers to refine their strategies to align more closely with expert feedback. By quantifying the impact of human feedback on reward models, we believe that influence functions can enhance feedback interpretability and contribute to scalable oversight in RLHF, helping labelers provide more accurate and consistent feedback.

InspireDebate: Multi-Dimensional Subjective-Objective Evaluation-Guided Reasoning and Optimization for Debating,"['Fuyu Wang', 'Jiangtong Li', 'Kun Zhu', 'Changjun Jiang']","With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), debating tasks, such as argument quality assessment and debate process simulation, have made significant progress. However, existing LLM-based debating systems focus on responding to specific arguments while neglecting objective assessments such as authenticity and logical validity. Furthermore, these systems lack a structured approach to optimize across various dimensions$-$including evaluation metrics, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement$-$thereby limiting their effectiveness. To address these interconnected challenges, we propose a dual-component framework: (1) $\textbf{InspireScore}$, a novel evaluation system that establishes a multi-dimensional assessment architecture incorporating four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity, argument arrangement, and topic relevance) alongside two objective metrics (fact authenticity and logical validity); and (2) $\textbf{InspireDebate}$, an optimized debating framework employing a phased optimization approach through CoT reasoning enhancement, multi-dimensional Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and real-time knowledge grounding via web-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (Web-RAG). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that $\textbf{InspireScore}$ achieves 44$\%$ higher correlation with expert judgments compared to existing methods, while $\textbf{InspireDebate}$ shows significant improvements, outperforming baseline models by 57$\%$.

Counterspeech the ultimate shield! Multi-Conditioned Counterspeech Generation through Attributed Prefix Learning,"['Aswini Kumar Padhi', 'Anil Bandhakavi', 'Tanmoy Chakraborty']","Counterspeech has proven to be a powerful tool to combat hate speech online. Previous studies have focused on generating counterspeech conditioned only on specific intents (single attributed). However, a holistic approach considering multiple attributes simultaneously can yield more nuanced and effective responses. Here, we introduce HiPPrO, Hierarchical Prefix learning with Preference Optimization, a novel two-stage framework that utilizes the effectiveness of attribute-specific prefix embedding spaces hierarchically optimized during the counterspeech generation process in the first phase. Thereafter, we incorporate both reference and reward-free preference optimization to generate more constructive counterspeech. Furthermore, we extend IntentCONANv2 by annotating all 13,973 counterspeech instances with emotion labels by five annotators. HiPPrO leverages hierarchical prefix optimization to integrate these dual attributes effectively. An extensive evaluation demonstrates that HiPPrO achieves a ~38 % improvement in intent conformity and a ~3 %, ~2 %, ~3 % improvement in Rouge-1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-L, respectively, compared to several baseline models. Human evaluations further substantiate the superiority of our approach, highlighting the enhanced relevance and appropriateness of the generated counterspeech. This work underscores the potential of multi-attribute conditioning in advancing the efficacy of counterspeech generation systems.

Unique Hard Attention: A Tale of Two Sides,"['Selim Jerad', 'Anej Svete', 'Jiaoda Li', 'Ryan Cotterell']","Understanding the expressive power of transformers has recently attracted attention, as it offers insights into their abilities and limitations. Many studies analyze unique hard attention transformers, where attention selects a single position that maximizes the attention scores. When multiple positions achieve the maximum score, either the rightmost or the leftmost of those is chosen. In this paper, we highlight the importance of this seeming triviality. Recently, finite-precision transformers with both leftmost- and rightmost-hard attention were shown to be equivalent to Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We show that this no longer holds with only leftmost-hard attention -- in that case, they correspond to a \emph{strictly weaker} fragment of LTL. Furthermore, we show that models with leftmost-hard attention are equivalent to \emph{soft} attention, suggesting they may better approximate real-world transformers than right-attention models. These findings refine the landscape of transformer expressivity and underscore the role of attention directionality.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14615v2

In this work, we propose a novel training-free framework for processing long texts, utilizing a divide-and-conquer strategy to achieve comprehensive document understanding. The proposed LLM$\times$MapReduce framework splits the entire document into several chunks for LLMs to read and then aggregates the intermediate answers to produce the final output. The main challenge for divide-and-conquer long text processing frameworks lies in the risk of losing essential long-range information when splitting the document, which can lead the model to produce incomplete or incorrect answers based on the segmented texts. Disrupted long-range information can be classified into two categories: inter-chunk dependency and inter-chunk conflict. We design a structured information protocol to better cope with inter-chunk dependency and an in-context confidence calibration mechanism to resolve inter-chunk conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM$\times$MapReduce can outperform representative open-source and commercial long-context LLMs, and is applicable to several different models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09342v1

However, the field faces staffing shortages and increasing workloads. While automated approaches using vision-language models (VLMs) show promise as assistants, they require exceptionally high accuracy. Most current VLMs in radiology rely solely on supervised fine-tuning. Meanwhile, additional preference fine-tuning in the post-training pipeline has become standard practice in the general domain. The challenge in radiology lies in the prohibitive cost of obtaining radiologist feedback at scale. To address this challenge, we propose an automated pipeline for preference feedback, focusing on chest X-ray radiology report generation (RRG). Specifically, our method leverages publicly available datasets containing pairs of images and radiologist-written reference reports with reference-based metrics, or Judges, eliminating the need for additional radiologist feedback.

PRISM: A Framework for Producing Interpretable Political Bias Embeddings with Political-Aware Cross-Encoder,"['Yiqun Sun', 'Qiang Huang', 'Anthony Kum Hoe Tung', 'Jun Yu']","Semantic Text Embedding is a fundamental NLP task that encodes textual content into vector representations, where proximity in the embedding space reflects semantic similarity. While existing embedding models excel at capturing general meaning, they often overlook ideological nuances, limiting their effectiveness in tasks that require an understanding of political bias. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM, the first framework designed to Produce inteRpretable polItical biaS eMbeddings. PRISM operates in two key stages: (1) Controversial Topic Bias Indicator Mining, which systematically extracts fine-grained political topics and their corresponding bias indicators from weakly labeled news data, and (2) Cross-Encoder Political Bias Embedding, which assigns structured bias scores to news articles based on their alignment with these indicators. This approach ensures that embeddings are explicitly tied to bias-revealing dimensions, enhancing both interpretability and predictive power. Through extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, we demonstrate that PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art text embedding models in political bias classification while offering highly interpretable representations that facilitate diversified retrieval and ideological analysis.

"Representations of Fact, Fiction and Forecast in Large Language Models: Epistemics and Attitudes","['Meng Li', 'Michael Vrazitulis', 'David Schlangen']","Rational speakers are supposed to know what they know and what they do not know, and to generate expressions matching the strength of evidence. In contrast, it is still a challenge for current large language models to generate corresponding utterances based on the assessment of facts and confidence in an uncertain real-world environment. While it has recently become popular to estimate and calibrate confidence of LLMs with verbalized uncertainty, what is lacking is a careful examination of the linguistic knowledge of uncertainty encoded in the latent space of LLMs. In this paper, we draw on typological frameworks of epistemic expressions to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of epistemic modality, using controlled stories. Our experiments show that the performance of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions is limited and not robust, and hence the expressions of uncertainty generated by LLMs are not always reliable. To build uncertainty-aware LLMs, it is necessary to enrich semantic knowledge of epistemic modality in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01512v1

To facilitate this paradigm, we propose Focus-Centric Data Synthesis, a scalable bottom-up approach for synthesizing high-quality data with elaborate reasoning paths. Through this approach, We construct VISC-150K, a large-scale dataset with reasoning data in the form of Focus-Centric Visual Chain, specifically designed for multi-image tasks.

Online Iterative Self-Alignment for Radiology Report Generation,"['Ting Xiao', 'Lei Shi', 'Yang Zhang', 'HaoFeng Yang', 'Zhe Wang', 'Chenjia Bai']","Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is an important research topic for relieving radiologist' heavy workload. Existing RRG models mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) based on different model architectures using data pairs of radiological images and corresponding radiologist-annotated reports.

However, the limited data coverage of high-quality annotated data poses risks of overfitting and generalization. This paper proposes a novel Online Iterative Self-Alignment (OISA) method for RRG that consists of four stages: self-generation of diverse data, self-evaluation for multi-objective preference data,self-alignment for multi-objective optimization and self-iteration for further improvement. Our approach allows for generating varied reports tailored to specific clinical objectives, enhancing the overall performance of the RRG model iteratively.

To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation, designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11 jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak attack algorithms.

T-REG: Preference Optimization with Token-Level Reward Regularization,"['Wenxuan Zhou', 'Shujian Zhang', 'Lingxiao Zhao', 'Tao Meng']","Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been crucial in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. Traditionally, RLHF involves generating responses to a query and using a reward model to assign a reward to the entire response. However, this approach faces challenges due to its reliance on a single, sparse reward, which makes it challenging for the model to identify which parts of the sequence contribute most significantly to the final reward. Recent methods have attempted to address this limitation by introducing token-level rewards. However, these methods often rely on either a trained credit assignment model or AI annotators, raising concerns about the quality and reliability of the rewards. In this paper, we propose token-level reward regularization (T-REG), a novel approach that leverages both sequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization. Harnessing the self-refinement capabilities of LLMs, our method uses contrastive prompting to enable LLMs to self-generate token-level rewards. These self-generated rewards then act as reward regularization, guiding the model to more effectively distribute sequence-level rewards across tokens. This facilitates better token-level credit assignment and enhances alignment performance. Experiments on the instruction following benchmarks, including Alpaca Eval 2 and Arena-Hard, show that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods by up to 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively. We will release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/T-REG.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02685v1

We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance.

In this paper, we introduce TISER, a novel framework that enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through a multi-stage process that combines timeline construction with iterative self-reflection. Our approach leverages test-time scaling to extend the length of reasoning traces, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. This strategy not only boosts reasoning accuracy but also improves the traceability of the inference process.

Inspired by the reinforcement learning from human feedback framework, we introduce a novel method that rewards both naturalness and content preservation. We experiment with multiple perspectives to produce more natural translations, aiming at reducing machine and human translationese.

In this paper, we investigate the adaption of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for document-level text generation tasks. MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs. Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text generation tasks is limited as many of the utility functions are designed for evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document using a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the performance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level machine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks.

Opt-Out: Investigating Entity-Level Unlearning for Large Language Models via Optimal Transport,"['Minseok Choi', 'Daniel Rim', 'Dohyun Lee', 'Jaegul Choo']","Instruction-following large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have become widely popular among everyday users. However, these models inadvertently disclose private, sensitive information to their users, underscoring the need for machine unlearning techniques to remove selective information from the models. While prior work has focused on forgetting small, random subsets of training data at the instance-level, we argue that real-world scenarios often require the removal of an entire user data, which may require a more careful maneuver. In this study, we explore entity-level unlearning, which aims to erase all knowledge related to a target entity while preserving the remaining model capabilities. To address this, we introduce Opt-Out, an optimal transport-based unlearning method that utilizes the Wasserstein distance from the model's initial parameters to achieve more effective and fine-grained unlearning. We also present the first Entity-Level Unlearning Dataset (ELUDe) designed to evaluate entity-level unlearning. Our empirical results demonstrate that Opt-Out surpasses existing methods, establishing a new standard for secure and adaptable LLMs that can accommodate user data removal requests without the need for full retraining.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12329v3
Mixture of Small and Large Models for Chinese Spelling Check,"['Ziheng Qiao', 'Houquan Zhou', 'Zhenghua Li']","In the era of large language models (LLMs), the Chinese Spelling Check (CSC) task has seen various LLM methods developed, yet their performance remains unsatisfactory. In contrast, fine-tuned BERT-based models, relying on high-quality in-domain data, show excellent performance but suffer from edit pattern overfitting. This paper proposes a novel dynamic mixture approach that effectively combines the probability distributions of small models and LLMs during the beam search decoding phase, achieving a balanced enhancement of precise corrections from small models and the fluency of LLMs. This approach also eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, saving significant time and resources, and facilitating domain adaptation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our mixture approach significantly boosts error correction capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.

DISC: Plug-and-Play Decoding Intervention with Similarity of Characters for Chinese Spelling Check,"['Ziheng Qiao', 'Houquan Zhou', 'Yumeng Liu', 'Zhenghua Li', 'Min Zhang', 'Bo Zhang', 'Chen Li', 'Ji Zhang', 'Fei Huang']","One key characteristic of the Chinese spelling check (CSC) task is that incorrect characters are usually similar to the correct ones in either phonetics or glyph. To accommodate this, previous works usually leverage confusion sets, which suffer from two problems, i.e., difficulty in determining which character pairs to include and lack of probabilities to distinguish items in the set. In this paper, we propose a light-weight plug-and-play DISC (i.e., decoding intervention with similarity of characters) module for CSC models.DISC measures phonetic and glyph similarities between characters and incorporates this similarity information only during the inference phase. This method can be easily integrated into various existing CSC models, such as ReaLiSe, SCOPE, and ReLM, without additional training costs. Experiments on three CSC benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves model performance, approaching and even surpassing the current state-of-the-art models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12863v2

And a variant is SVFormer, where all layers share the first layer's value embedding. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 16.11\% fewer model parameters and 20.3\% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost.

SGIC: A Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework for RAG,"['Guanhua Chen', 'Yutong Yao', 'Lidia S. Chao', 'Xuebo Liu', 'Derek F. Wong']","Recent research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has concentrated on retrieving useful information from candidate documents. However, numerous methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess. This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16172v1

Hierarchical-Task-Aware Multi-modal Mixture of Incremental LoRA Experts for Embodied Continual Learning,"['Ziqi Jia', 'Anmin Wang', 'Xiaoyang Qu', 'Xiaowen Yang', 'Jianzong Wang']","Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks, preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04595v1
SpindleKV: A Novel KV Cache Reduction Method Balancing Both Shallow and Deep Layers,"['Zicong Tang', 'Shi Luohe', 'Zuchao Li', 'Baoyuan Qi', 'Liu Guoming', 'Lefei Zhang', 'Ping Wang']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV, which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar or even better model performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06517v1

Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Binary-coding quantization (BCQ) and uniform quantization (UQ) are promising quantization schemes that have strong expressiveness and optimizability, respectively. However, neither scheme leverages both advantages. In this paper, we propose UniQuanF (Unified Quantization with Flexible Mapping), an accurate quantization method for LLMs. UniQuanF harnesses both strong expressiveness and optimizability by unifying the flexible mapping technique in UQ and non-uniform quantization levels of BCQ. We propose unified initialization, and local and periodic mapping techniques to optimize the parameters in UniQuanF precisely. After optimization, our unification theorem removes computational and memory overhead, allowing us to utilize the superior accuracy of UniQuanF without extra deployment costs induced by the unification. Experimental results demonstrate that UniQuanF outperforms existing UQ and BCQ methods, achieving up to 4.60% higher accuracy on GSM8K benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03781v2

The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language.

Multi-Facet Blending for Faceted Query-by-Example Retrieval,"['Heejin Do', 'Sangwon Ryu', 'Jonghwi Kim', 'Gary Lee']","With the growing demand to fit fine-grained user intents, faceted query-by-example (QBE), which retrieves similar documents conditioned on specific facets, has gained recent attention. However, prior approaches mainly depend on document-level comparisons using basic indicators like citations due to the lack of facet-level relevance datasets; yet, this limits their use to citation-based domains and fails to capture the intricacies of facet constraints. In this paper, we propose a multi-facet blending (FaBle) augmentation method, which exploits modularity by decomposing and recomposing to explicitly synthesize facet-specific training sets. We automatically decompose documents into facet units and generate (ir)relevant pairs by leveraging LLMs' intrinsic distinguishing capabilities; then, dynamically recomposing the units leads to facet-wise relevance-informed document pairs. Our modularization eliminates the need for pre-defined facet knowledge or labels. Further, to prove the FaBle's efficacy in a new domain beyond citation-based scientific paper retrieval, we release a benchmark dataset for educational exam item QBE. FaBle augmentation on 1K documents remarkably assists training in obtaining facet conditional embeddings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01443v1

We construct a novel dataset tailored for training and evaluating retrievers on MIR, and establish baselines. To address MIR, we build the Methodology Adjacency Graph (MAG); capturing methodological lineage through citation relationships. We leverage MAG to embed an ""intuitive prior"" into dense retrievers for identifying patterns of methodological inspiration beyond superficial semantic similarity. This achieves significant gains of +5.4 in Recall@3 and +7.8 in Mean Average Precision (mAP) over strong baselines. Further, we adapt LLM-based re-ranking strategies to MIR, yielding additional improvements of +4.5 in Recall@3 and +4.8 in mAP.

Results on three language directions (English-French/Italian/Spanish) indicate that while traditional encoder-decoder models capture gender information, newer architectures -- integrating a speech encoder with a machine translation system via adapters -- do not.

Memorizing is Not Enough: Deep Knowledge Injection Through Reasoning,"['Ruoxi Xu', 'Yunjie Ji', 'Boxi Cao', 'Yaojie Lu', 'Hongyu Lin', 'Xianpei Han', 'Ben He', 'Yingfei Sun', 'Xiangang Li', 'Le Sun']","Although large language models (LLMs) excel in knowledge recall and reasoning, their static nature leads to outdated information as the real world evolves or when adapting to domain-specific knowledge, highlighting the need for effective knowledge injection.

This paper proposes a four-tier knowledge injection framework that systematically defines the levels of knowledge injection: memorization, retrieval, reasoning, and association. Based on this framework, we introduce DeepKnowledge, a synthetic experimental testbed designed for fine-grained evaluation of the depth of knowledge injection across three knowledge types (novel, incremental, and updated). We then explore various knowledge injection scenarios and evaluate the depth of knowledge injection for each scenario on the benchmark. Experimental results reveal key factors to reach each level of knowledge injection for LLMs and establish a mapping between the levels of knowledge injection and the corresponding suitable injection methods, aiming to provide a comprehensive approach for efficient knowledge injection across various levels.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00472v1
Improving Dialogue State Tracking through Combinatorial Search for In-Context Examples,"['Haesung Pyun', 'Yoonah Park', 'Yohan Jo']","In dialogue state tracking (DST), in-context learning comprises a retriever that selects labeled dialogues as in-context examples and a DST model that uses these examples to infer the dialogue state of the query dialogue. Existing methods for constructing training data for retrievers suffer from three key limitations: (1) the synergistic effect of examples is not considered, (2) the linguistic characteristics of the query are not sufficiently factored in, and (3) scoring is not directly optimized for DST performance. Consequently, the retriever can fail to retrieve examples that would substantially improve DST performance. To address these issues, we present CombiSearch, a method that scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST performance. Our evaluation on MultiWOZ shows that retrievers trained with CombiSearch surpass state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20x gain in data efficiency and generalizing well to the SGD dataset. Moreover, CombiSearch attains a 12% absolute improvement in the upper bound DST performance over traditional approaches when no retrieval errors are assumed. This significantly increases the headroom for practical DST performance while demonstrating that existing methods rely on suboptimal data for retriever training.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00622v2

Length-Induced Embedding Collapse in PLM-based Models,"['Yuqi Zhou', 'Sunhao Dai', 'Zhanshuo Cao', 'Xiao Zhang', 'Jun Xu']","Text embeddings from PLM-based models enable a wide range of applications, yet their performance often degrades on longer texts. In this paper, we introduce a phenomenon we call Length Collapse, where embeddings of longer texts tend to cluster together. This clustering results in a distributional inconsistency between the embeddings of short and long texts. We further investigate how these differences contribute to the performance decline observed with longer texts across various downstream tasks. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis of the self-attention mechanism, which acts as a low-pass filter in PLM-based models, we demonstrate that as text length increases, the strength of low-pass filtering intensifies, causing embeddings to retain more low-frequency components. As a result, input token features become more similar, leading to clustering and ultimately the collapse of embeddings for longer texts. To address this issue, we propose a simple method, TempScale, which mitigates the Length Collapse phenomenon. By narrowing the gap in low-pass filtering rates between long and short texts, TempScale ensures more consistent embeddings across different text lengths. This approach leads to performance improvements of 0.94% on MTEB and 1.10% on LongEmbed, which focuses specifically on long-context retrieval, providing strong evidence for the validity of our analysis.

ERU-KG: Efficient Reference-aligned Unsupervised Keyphrase Generation,"['Lam Thanh Do', 'Aaditya Bodke', 'Pritom Saha Akash', 'Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang']","Unsupervised keyphrase prediction has gained growing interest in recent years. However, existing methods typically rely on heuristically defined importance scores, which may lead to inaccurate informativeness estimation. In addition, they lack consideration for time efficiency. To solve these problems, we propose ERU-KG, an unsupervised keyphrase generation (UKG) model that consists of an informativeness and a phraseness module. The former estimates the relevance of keyphrase candidates, while the latter generate those candidates. The informativeness module innovates by learning to model informativeness through references (e.g., queries, citation contexts, and titles) and at the term-level, thereby 1) capturing how the key concepts of documents are perceived in different contexts and 2) estimating informativeness of phrases more efficiently by aggregating term informativeness, removing the need for explicit modeling of the candidates. ERU-KG demonstrates its effectiveness on keyphrase generation benchmarks by outperforming unsupervised baselines and achieving on average 89\% of the performance of a supervised model for top 10 predictions. Additionally, to highlight its practical utility, we evaluate the model on text retrieval tasks and show that keyphrases generated by ERU-KG are effective when employed as query and document expansions. Furthermore, inference speed tests reveal that ERU-KG is the fastest among baselines of similar model sizes. Finally, our proposed model can switch between keyphrase generation and extraction by adjusting hyperparameters, catering to diverse application requirements.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24219v1
Know Your Mistakes: Towards Preventing Overreliance on Task-Oriented Conversational AI Through Accountability Modeling,"['Suvodip Dey', 'Yi-Jyun Sun', 'Gokhan Tur', 'Dilek Hakkani-Tür']","Recent LLMs have enabled significant advancements for conversational agents. However, they are also well known to hallucinate, producing responses that seem plausible but are factually incorrect. On the other hand, users tend to over-rely on LLM-based AI agents, accepting AI's suggestion even when it is wrong. Adding positive friction, such as explanations or getting user confirmations, has been proposed as a mitigation in AI-supported decision-making systems. In this paper, we propose an accountability model for LLM-based task-oriented dialogue agents to address user overreliance via friction turns in cases of model uncertainty and errors associated with dialogue state tracking (DST). The accountability model is an augmented LLM with an additional accountability head that functions as a binary classifier to predict the relevant slots of the dialogue state mentioned in the conversation. We perform our experiments with multiple backbone LLMs on two established benchmarks (MultiWOZ and Snips). Our empirical findings demonstrate that the proposed approach not only enables reliable estimation of AI agent errors but also guides the decoder in generating more accurate actions. We observe around 3% absolute improvement in joint goal accuracy (JGA) of DST output by incorporating accountability heads into modern LLMs. Self-correcting the detected errors further increases the JGA from 67.13 to 70.51, achieving state-of-the-art DST performance. Finally, we show that error correction through user confirmations (friction turn) achieves a similar performance gain, highlighting its potential to reduce user overreliance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10316v4

Mainstream methods, such as CoT/ReAct, rely on step-by-step tool invocation to interact with external environments, but they are limited in perceptual scope and lack adequate task-planning capability. To address these limitations, other studies introduce the first Search-based Decision Tree (DFSDT), which still suffers from the high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel parallel tool invocation paradigm, DTA-Llama (Divide-Then-Aggregate Llama). First, we transform traditional tree-based tool search paths into Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, generating a high-quality parallel tool invocation dataset. The DTA-Llama is then trained on the dataset to learn to iteratively divide the current task into several parallel tool invocation sub-tasks and aggregate the invocation results to decide the next actions. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient inference framework inspired by the Process/Threads mechanism when applying the DTA-Llama to practical tasks. Experimental results show that our approach substantially enhances task performance while reducing token consumption and inference time.

Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and 6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians' restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration.

To address these issues, we investigate how to construct more comprehensive and diversified contrasting patterns to enhance preference data (RQ1) and verify the impact of the diversification of contrasting patterns on model alignment (RQ2). For RQ1, we propose PopAlign, a framework that integrates diversified contrasting patterns across the prompt, model, and pipeline levels, introducing six contrasting strategies that do not require additional feedback labeling procedures.

In general, the interaction between anonymization and data utility requires a deeper understanding within the context of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a framework composed of three key LLM-based components: a privacy evaluator, a utility evaluator, and an optimization component, which work collaboratively to perform anonymization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing baselines, showing robustness in reducing the risk of re-identification while preserving greater data utility in downstream tasks. We provide detailed studies on these core modules. To consider large-scale and real-time applications, we investigate the distillation of the anonymization capabilities into lightweight models. All of our code and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/UKPLab/acl2025-rupta.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11770v2
SEAL: Scaling to Emphasize Attention for Long-Context Retrieval,"['Changhun Lee', 'Minsang Seok', 'Jun-gyu Jin', 'YoungHyun Cho', 'Eunhyeok Park']","While many advanced LLMs are designed to handle long sequence data, we can still observe notable quality degradation even within the sequence limit. In this work, we introduce a novel approach called Scaling to Emphasize Attention for Long-context retrieval (SEAL), which enhances the retrieval performance of large language models (LLMs) over long contexts. We observe that specific attention heads are closely tied to long-context retrieval, showing positive or negative correlation with retrieval scores, and adjusting the strength of these heads boosts the quality of LLMs in long context by a large margin. Built on this insight, we propose a learning-based mechanism that leverages generated data to emphasize these heads. By applying SEAL, we achieve significant improvements in long-context retrieval performance across various tasks and models. Additionally, when combined with existing training-free context extension techniques, SEAL extends the contextual limits of LLMs while maintaining highly reliable outputs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15225v2

Previous studies show that semantic parsing enhances the performance of smaller models (e.g., BERT) on downstream tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the improvements extend similarly to LLMs. In this paper, our empirical findings reveal that, unlike smaller models, directly adding semantic parsing results into LLMs reduces their performance. To overcome this, we propose SENSE, a novel prompting approach that embeds semantic hints within the prompt. Experiments show that SENSE consistently improves LLMs' performance across various tasks, highlighting the potential of integrating semantic information to improve LLM capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14469v2

Performance Gap in Entity Knowledge Extraction Across Modalities in Vision Language Models,"['Ido Cohen', 'Daniela Gottesman', 'Mor Geva', 'Raja Giryes']","Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at extracting and reasoning about information from images. Yet, their capacity to leverage internal knowledge about specific entities remains underexplored. This work investigates the disparity in model performance when answering factual questions about an entity described in text versus depicted in an image. Our results reveal a significant accuracy drop - reaching 18% for some models - when the entity is presented visually instead of textually. To study this gap we present PopVQA, a dataset which allows separating entity recognition and question answering, and use it to benchmark several models. We hypothesize that this decline arises from limitations in how information flows from image tokens to query tokens. Thus, we use mechanistic interpretability tools to reveal that, although image tokens are preprocessed by the vision encoder, meaningful information flow from these tokens occurs only in the much deeper layers. Furthermore, critical image processing happens in the language model's middle layers, allowing few layers for consecutive reasoning, highlighting a potential inefficiency in how the model utilizes its layers for reasoning. These insights shed light on the internal mechanics of VLMs and offer pathways for enhancing their reasoning capabilities.

Structured pruning reduces model size and speeds up inference but often causes uneven degradation across domains, leading to biased performance. To address this, we propose DRPruning, a method that dynamically adjusts the data distribution during training to restore balanced performance across heterogeneous and multi-tasking data. Experiments in monolingual and multilingual settings show that DRPruning surpasses similarly sized models in both pruning and continued pretraining over perplexity, downstream tasks, and instruction tuning. Further analysis demonstrates the robustness of DRPruning towards various domains and distribution shifts. Furthermore, DRPruning can determine optimal reference losses and data ratios automatically, suggesting potential for broader applications.

We find that AAL is underrepresented in all evaluated pretraining corpora compared to US demographics, constituting as little as 0.007% of documents. We also find that more than 25% of AAL texts in C4 may be inappropriate for LLMs to generate and reinforce harmful stereotypes.

While LLMs have improved at processing long inputs, MD contexts still present unique difficulties, including management of inter-document dependencies, redundancy, and incoherent structures. To address this challenge, we introduce MDCure, a scalable and effective instruction data generation framework to enhance the MD capabilities of LLMs without the computational cost of pre-training or reliance on human-annotated data. MDCure generates high-quality synthetic MD instruction data over sets of articles via targeted prompts.

Current methodologies, including automated metrics, human assessments, and LLM-based evaluations, predominantly focus on English, revealing a significant gap in multilingual evaluation frameworks. We introduce the Cross Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite, an extensible framework that includes evaluator LLMs (Hercule) and a novel test set (Recon) specifically designed for multilingual evaluation. Our test set features 500 human-annotated instructions spanning various task capabilities along with human judgment scores across six languages. This would enable benchmarking of general-purpose multilingual LLMs and facilitate meta-evaluation of Evaluator LLMs. The proposed model, Hercule, is a cross-lingual evaluation model that addresses the scarcity of reference answers in the target language by learning to assign scores to responses based on easily available reference answers in English. Our experiments demonstrate that Hercule aligns more closely with human judgments compared to proprietary models, demonstrating the effectiveness of such cross-lingual evaluation in low resource scenarios. Further, it is also effective in zero-shot evaluation on unseen languages. This study is the first comprehensive examination of cross-lingual evaluation using LLMs, presenting a scalable and effective approach for multilingual assessment.

Bypass Back-propagation: Optimization-based Structural Pruning for Large Language Models via Policy Gradient,"['Yuan Gao', 'Zujing Liu', 'WEIZHONG ZHANG', 'Bo Du', 'Gui-Song Xia']","Recent Large-Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods typically operate at the post-training phase without the expensive weight finetuning, however, their pruning criteria often rely on heuristically hand-crafted metrics, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. We instead propose a novel optimization-based structural pruning that learns the pruning masks in a probabilistic space directly by optimizing the loss of the pruned model. To preserve efficiency, our method eliminates the back-propagation through the LLM per se during optimization, requiring only the forward pass of the LLM. We achieve this by learning an underlying Bernoulli distribution to sample binary pruning masks, where we decouple the Bernoulli parameters from LLM loss, facilitating efficient optimization via policy gradient estimator without back-propagation. Thus, our method can 1) support global and heterogeneous pruning (i.e., automatically determine different redundancy for different layers), and 2) optionally initialize with a metric-based method (for our Bernoulli distributions). Extensive experiments conducted on LLaMA, LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Vicuna, and Mistral models using the C4 and WikiText2 datasets demonstrate the promising performance of our method in efficiency and effectiveness.

Tree-of-Debate: Multi-Persona Debate Trees Elicit Critical Thinking for Scientific Comparative Analysis,"['Priyanka Kargupta', 'Ishika Agarwal', 'Tal August', 'Jiawei Han']","With the exponential growth of research facilitated by modern technology and improved accessibility, scientific discoveries have become increasingly fragmented within and across fields.

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong quantitative and qualitative reasoning abilities, and multi-agent LLM debates have shown promise in handling complex reasoning tasks by exploring diverse perspectives and reasoning paths. Inspired by this, we introduce Tree-of-Debate (ToD), a framework which converts scientific papers into LLM personas that debate their respective novelties. To emphasize structured, critical reasoning rather than focusing solely on outcomes, ToD dynamically constructs a debate tree, enabling fine-grained analysis of independent novelty arguments within scholarly articles.

This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline, improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units.

Class Distillation with Mahalanobis Contrast: An Efficient Training Paradigm for Pragmatic Language Understanding Tasks,"['Chenlu Wang', 'Weimin Lyu', 'Ritwik Banerjee']","Detecting deviant language such as sexism, or nuanced language such as metaphors or sarcasm, is crucial for enhancing the safety, clarity, and interpretation of online social discourse.

ClaD integrates two key innovations: (i) a loss function informed by the structural properties of class distributions, based on Mahalanobis distance, and (ii) an interpretable decision algorithm optimized for class separation. Across three benchmark detection tasks -- sexism, metaphor, and sarcasm -- ClaD outperforms competitive baselines, and even with smaller language models and orders of magnitude fewer parameters, achieves performance comparable to several large language models (LLMs). These results demonstrate ClaD as an efficient tool for pragmatic language understanding tasks that require gleaning a small target class from a larger heterogeneous background.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11829v1

In the SCPT phase, we automatically extract the domain knowledge taxonomy and reorganize the training corpora, enabling LLMs to effectively link textual segments to targeted knowledge points within the taxonomy. In the SSFT phase, we explicitly prompt models to elucidate the underlying knowledge structure in their outputs, leveraging the structured domain insight to address practical problems. Our ultimate method was extensively evaluated across model architectures and scales on LongBench and MMedBench datasets, demonstrating superior performance against other knowledge injection methods.

Reconsidering LLM Uncertainty Estimation Methods in the Wild,"['Duygu Nur Yaldiz', 'Yavuz Faruk Bakman', 'Sungmin Kang', 'Tuo Zhang', 'Baturalp Buyukates', 'Sai Praneeth Karimireddy', 'Salman Avestimehr']","Large Language Model (LLM) Uncertainty Estimation (UE) methods have become a crucial tool for detecting hallucinations in recent years. While numerous UE methods have been proposed, most existing studies evaluate them in isolated short-form QA settings using threshold-independent metrics such as AUROC or PRR. However, real-world deployment of UE methods introduces several challenges. In this work, we systematically examine four key aspects of deploying UE methods in practical settings. Specifically, we assess (1) the sensitivity of UE methods to decision threshold selection, (2) their robustness to query transformations such as typos, adversarial prompts, and prior chat history, (3) their applicability to long-form generation, and (4) strategies for handling multiple UE scores for a single query. Our evaluations on 19 UE methods reveal that most of them are highly sensitive to threshold selection when there is a distribution shift in the calibration dataset. While these methods generally exhibit robustness against previous chat history and typos, they are significantly vulnerable to adversarial prompts. Additionally, while existing UE methods can be adapted for long-form generation through various strategies, there remains considerable room for improvement. Lastly, ensembling multiple UE scores at test time provides a notable performance boost, which highlights its potential as a practical improvement strategy.

Synergizing Unsupervised Episode Detection with LLMs for Large-Scale News Events,"['Priyanka Kargupta', 'Yunyi Zhang', 'Yizhu Jiao', 'Siru Ouyang', 'Jiawei Han']","State-of-the-art automatic event detection struggles with interpretability and adaptability to evolving large-scale key events -- unlike episodic structures, which excel in these areas. Often overlooked, episodes represent cohesive clusters of core entities performing actions at a specific time and location; a partially ordered sequence of episodes can represent a key event. This paper introduces a novel task, episode detection, which identifies episodes within a news corpus of key event articles. Detecting episodes poses unique challenges, as they lack explicit temporal or locational markers and cannot be merged using semantic similarity alone. While large language models (LLMs) can aid with these reasoning difficulties, they suffer with long contexts typical of news corpora. To address these challenges, we introduce EpiMine, an unsupervised framework that identifies a key event's candidate episodes by leveraging natural episodic partitions in articles, estimated through shifts in discriminative term combinations. These candidate episodes are more cohesive and representative of true episodes, synergizing with LLMs to better interpret and refine them into final episodes. We apply EpiMine to our three diverse, real-world event datasets annotated at the episode level, where it achieves a 59.2% average gain across all metrics compared to baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04873v2
Beyond True or False: Retrieval-Augmented Hierarchical Analysis of Nuanced Claims,"['Priyanka Kargupta', 'Runchu Tian', 'Jiawei Han']","Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be clearly labeled as entirely ""true"" or ""false"" -- as is frequently the case with scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., ""vaccine A is better than vaccine B"") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects (e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects. Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective prevalence (e.g., ""how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more transportable than B?""). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10728v1
The Task Shield: Enforcing Task Alignment to Defend Against Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents,"['Feiran Jia', 'Tong Wu', 'Xin Qin', 'Anna Squicciarini']","Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly being deployed as conversational assistants capable of performing complex real-world tasks through tool integration. This enhanced ability to interact with external systems and process various data sources, while powerful, introduces significant security vulnerabilities. In particular, indirect prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat, where malicious instructions embedded within external data sources can manipulate agents to deviate from user intentions. While existing defenses based on rule constraints, source spotlighting, and authentication protocols show promise, they struggle to maintain robust security while preserving task functionality. We propose a novel and orthogonal perspective that reframes agent security from preventing harmful actions to ensuring task alignment, requiring every agent action to serve user objectives. Based on this insight, we develop Task Shield, a test-time defense mechanism that systematically verifies whether each instruction and tool call contributes to user-specified goals. Through experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark, we demonstrate that Task Shield reduces attack success rates (2.07\%) while maintaining high task utility (69.79\%) on GPT-4o.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16682v1
Sandcastles in the Storm: Revisiting the (Im)possibility of Strong Watermarking,"['Fabrice Y Harel-Canada', 'Boran Erol', 'Connor Choi', 'Jason Liu', 'Gary Jiarui Song', 'Nanyun Peng', 'Amit Sahai']","Watermarking AI-generated text is critical for combating misuse. Yet recent theoretical work argues that any watermark can be erased via random walk attacks that perturb text while preserving quality. However, such attacks rely on two key assumptions: (1) rapid mixing (watermarks dissolve quickly under perturbations) and (2) reliable quality preservation (automated quality oracles perfectly guide edits). Through large-scale experiments and human-validated assessments, we find mixing is slow: 100% of perturbed texts retain traces of their origin after hundreds of edits, defying rapid mixing. Oracles falter, as state-of-the-art quality detectors misjudge edits (77% accuracy), compounding errors during attacks. Ultimately, attacks underperform: automated walks remove watermarks just 26% of the time -- dropping to 10% under human quality review. These findings challenge the inevitability of watermark removal. Instead, practical barriers -- slow mixing and imperfect quality control -- reveal watermarking to be far more robust than theoretical models suggest. The gap between idealized attacks and real-world feasibility underscores the need for stronger watermarking methods and more realistic attack models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06827v1

From Perceptions to Decisions: Wildfire Evacuation Decision Prediction with Behavioral Theory-informed LLMs,"['Ruxiao Chen', 'Chenguang Wang', 'Yuran Sun', 'Xilei Zhao', 'Susu Xu']","Evacuation decision prediction is critical for efficient and effective wildfire response by helping emergency management anticipate traffic congestion and bottlenecks, allocate resources, and minimize negative impacts. Traditional statistical methods for evacuation decision prediction fail to capture the complex and diverse behavioral logic of different individuals. In this work, for the first time, we introduce FLARE, short for facilitating LLM for advanced reasoning on wildfire evacuation decision prediction, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework that integrates behavioral theories and models to streamline the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and subsequently integrate with memory-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) module to provide accurate evacuation decision prediction and understanding. Our proposed method addresses the limitations of using existing LLMs for evacuation behavioral predictions, such as limited survey data, mismatching with behavioral theory, conflicting individual preferences, implicit and complex mental states, and intractable mental state-behavior mapping. Experiments on three post-wildfire survey datasets show an average of 20.47% performance improvement over traditional theory-informed behavioral models, with strong cross-event generalizability.

GETReason: Enhancing Image Context Extraction through Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reasoning,"['Shikhhar Siingh', 'Abhinav Rawat', 'Chitta Baral', 'Vivek Gupta']","Publicly significant images from events hold valuable contextual information, crucial for journalism and education. However, existing methods often struggle to extract this relevance accurately. To address this, we introduce GETReason (Geospatial Event Temporal Reasoning), a framework that moves beyond surface-level image descriptions to infer deeper contextual meaning. We propose that extracting global event, temporal, and geospatial information enhances understanding of an image's significance. Additionally, we introduce GREAT (Geospatial Reasoning and Event Accuracy with Temporal Alignment), a new metric for evaluating reasoning-based image understanding. Our layered multi-agent approach, assessed using a reasoning-weighted metric, demonstrates that meaningful insights can be inferred, effectively linking images to their broader event context.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21863v3
Hanging in the Balance: Pivotal Moments in Crisis Counseling Conversations,"['Vivian Nguyen', 'Lillian Lee', 'Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil']","During a conversation, there can come certain moments where its outcome hangs in the balance. In these pivotal moments, how one responds can put the conversation on substantially different trajectories leading to significantly different outcomes. Systems that can detect when such moments arise could assist conversationalists in domains with highly consequential outcomes, such as mental health crisis counseling. In this work, we introduce an unsupervised computational method for detecting such pivotal moments as they happen, in an online fashion. Our approach relies on the intuition that a moment is pivotal if our expectation of the outcome varies widely depending on what might be said next. By applying our method to crisis counseling conversations, we first validate it by showing that it aligns with human perception -- counselors take significantly longer to respond during moments detected by our method -- and with the eventual conversational trajectory -- which is more likely to change course at these times. We then use our framework to explore the relation of the counselor's response during pivotal moments with the eventual outcome of the session.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03941v1

TaxoAdapt: Aligning LLM-Based Multidimensional Taxonomy Construction to Evolving Research Corpora,"['Priyanka Kargupta', 'Nan Zhang', 'Yunyi Zhang', 'Rui Zhang', 'Prasenjit Mitra', 'Jiawei Han']","The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1) over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks, evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus' topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive baselines judged by LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10737v1

Retrofitting Large Language Models with Dynamic Tokenization,"['Darius Feher', 'Ivan Vulić', 'Benjamin Minixhofer']","Current language models (LMs) use a fixed, static subword tokenizer. This default choice typically results in degraded efficiency and language capabilities, especially in languages other than English. To address this issue, we challenge the static design and propose retrofitting LMs with dynamic tokenization: a way to dynamically decide on token boundaries based on the input text via a subword-merging algorithm inspired by byte-pair encoding. We merge frequent subword sequences in a batch, then apply a pre-trained embedding-prediction hypernetwork to compute the token embeddings on-the-fly. For encoder-style models (e.g., XLM-R), this on average reduces token sequence lengths by >20% across 14 languages while degrading performance by less than 2%. The same method applied to pre-filling and scoring in decoder-style models (e.g., Mistral-7B) results in minimal performance degradation at up to 17% reduction in sequence length. Overall, we find that dynamic tokenization can mitigate the limitations of static tokenization by substantially improving inference speed and promoting fairness across languages, enabling more equitable and adaptable LMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18553v3
Principled Content Selection to Generate Diverse and Personalized Multi-Document Summaries,"['Vishakh Padmakumar', 'Zichao Wang', 'David Arbour', 'Jennifer Healey']","While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of handling longer contexts, recent work has demonstrated that they exhibit the ""lost in the middle"" phenomenon (Liu et al., 2024) of unevenly attending to different parts of the provided context. This hinders their ability to cover diverse source material in multi-document summarization, as noted in the DiverseSumm benchmark (Huang et al., 2024). In this work, we contend that principled content selection is a simple way to increase source coverage on this task. As opposed to prompting an LLM to perform the summarization in a single step, we explicitly divide the task into three steps -- (1) reducing document collections to atomic key points, (2) using determinantal point processes (DPP) to perform select key points that prioritize diverse content, and (3) rewriting to the final summary. By combining prompting steps, for extraction and rewriting, with principled techniques, for content selection, we consistently improve source coverage on the DiverseSumm benchmark across various LLMs. Finally, we also show that by incorporating relevance to a provided user intent into the DPP kernel, we can generate personalized summaries that cover relevant source information while retaining coverage.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21859v1

GrammaMT proposes three prompting strategies: gloss-shot, chain-gloss and model-gloss. All are training-free, requiring only a few examples that involve minimal effort to collect, and making them well-suited for low-resource setups. Experiments show that GrammaMT enhances translation performance on open-source instruction-tuned LLMs for various low- to high-resource languages across three benchmarks: (1) the largest IGT corpus, (2) the challenging 2023 SIGMORPHON Shared Task data over endangered languages, and (3) even in an out-of-domain setting with FLORES.

Theorem Prover as a Judge for Synthetic Data Generation,"['Joshua Ong Jun Leang', 'Giwon Hong', 'Wenda Li', 'Shay B Cohen']","The demand for synthetic data in mathematical reasoning has increased due to its potential to enhance the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, ensuring the validity of intermediate reasoning steps remains a significant challenge, affecting data quality. While formal verification via theorem provers effectively validates LLM reasoning, the autoformalisation of mathematical proofs remains error-prone. In response, we introduce iterative autoformalisation, an approach that iteratively refines theorem prover formalisation to mitigate errors, thereby increasing the execution rate on the Lean prover from 60% to 87%. Building upon that, we introduce Theorem Prover as a Judge (TP-as-a-Judge), a method that employs theorem prover formalisation to rigorously assess LLM intermediate reasoning, effectively integrating autoformalisation with synthetic data generation. Finally, we present Reinforcement Learning from Theorem Prover Feedback (RLTPF), a framework that replaces human annotation with theorem prover feedback in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Across multiple LLMs, applying TP-as-a-Judge and RLTPF improves benchmarks with only 3,508 samples, achieving 5.56% accuracy gain on Mistral-7B for MultiArith, 6.00% on Llama-2-7B for SVAMP, and 3.55% on Llama-3.1-8B for AQUA.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13137v1
Measuring the Effect of Transcription Noise on Downstream Language Understanding Tasks,"['Ori Shapira', 'Shlomo Chazan', 'Amir David Nissan Cohen']","With the increasing prevalence of recorded human speech, spoken language understanding (SLU) is essential for its efficient processing. In order to process the speech, it is commonly transcribed using automatic speech recognition technology. This speech-to-text transition introduces errors into the transcripts, which subsequently propagate to downstream NLP tasks, such as dialogue summarization. While it is known that transcript noise affects downstream tasks, a systematic approach to analyzing its effects across different noise severities and types has not been addressed. We propose a configurable framework for assessing task models in diverse noisy settings, and for examining the impact of transcript-cleaning techniques. The framework facilitates the investigation of task model behavior, which can in turn support the development of effective SLU solutions. We exemplify the utility of our framework on three SLU tasks and four task models, offering insights regarding the effect of transcript noise on tasks in general and models in particular. For instance, we find that task models can tolerate a certain level of noise, and are affected differently by the types of errors in the transcript.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13645v1

METAL: A Multi-Agent Framework for Chart Generation with Test-Time Scaling,"['Bingxuan Li', 'Yiwei Wang', 'Jiuxiang Gu', 'Kai-Wei Chang', 'Nanyun Peng']","Chart generation aims to generate code to produce charts satisfying the desired visual properties, e.g., texts, layout, color, and type. It has great potential to empower the automatic professional report generation in financial analysis, research presentation, education, and healthcare. In this work, we build a vision-language model (VLM) based multi-agent framework for effective automatic chart generation. Generating high-quality charts requires both strong visual design skills and precise coding capabilities that embed the desired visual properties into code. Such a complex multi-modal reasoning process is difficult for direct prompting of VLMs. To resolve these challenges, we propose METAL, a multi-agent framework that decomposes the task of chart generation into the iterative collaboration among specialized agents. METAL achieves 5.2% improvement over the current best result in the chart generation task. The METAL framework exhibits the phenomenon of test-time scaling: its performance increases monotonically as the logarithmic computational budget grows from 512 to 8192 tokens. In addition, we find that separating different modalities during the critique process of METAL boosts the self-correction capability of VLMs in the multimodal context.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17651v3

Therefore, we present Mismatched Eraser (MEraser), a novel method for effectively removing backdoor-based fingerprints from LLMs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages a two-phase fine-tuning strategy utilizing carefully constructed mismatched and clean datasets. Through extensive evaluation across multiple LLM architectures and fingerprinting methods, we demonstrate that MEraser achieves complete fingerprinting removal while maintaining model performance with minimal training data of fewer than 1,000 samples. Furthermore, we introduce a transferable erasure mechanism that enables effective fingerprinting removal across different models without repeated training. In conclusion, our approach provides a practical solution for fingerprinting removal in LLMs, reveals critical vulnerabilities in current fingerprinting techniques, and establishes comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for developing more resilient model protection methods in the future.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12551v1

To address this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Visual Source Attribution (VISA), a novel approach that combines answer generation with visual source attribution. Leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs), VISA identifies the evidence and highlights the exact regions that support the generated answers with bounding boxes in the retrieved document screenshots. To evaluate its effectiveness, we curated two datasets: Wiki-VISA, based on crawled Wikipedia webpage screenshots, and Paper-VISA, derived from PubLayNet and tailored to the medical domain. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VISA for visual source attribution on documents' original look, as well as highlighting the challenges for improvement.

Stochastic Chameleons: Irrelevant Context Hallucinations Reveal Class-Based (Mis)Generalization in LLMs,"['Ziling Cheng', 'Meng Cao', 'Marc-Antoine Rondeau', 'Jackie CK Cheung']","The widespread success of large language models (LLMs) on NLP benchmarks has been accompanied by concerns that LLMs function primarily as stochastic parrots that reproduce texts similar to what they saw during pre-training, often erroneously. But what is the nature of their errors, and do these errors exhibit any regularities? In this work, we examine irrelevant context hallucinations, in which models integrate misleading contextual cues into their predictions. Through behavioral analysis, we show that these errors result from a structured yet flawed mechanism that we term class-based (mis)generalization, in which models combine abstract class cues with features extracted from the query or context to derive answers. Furthermore, mechanistic interpretability experiments on Llama-3, Mistral, and Pythia across 39 factual recall relation types reveal that this behavior is reflected in the model's internal computations: (i) abstract class representations are constructed in lower layers before being refined into specific answers in higher layers, (ii) feature selection is governed by two competing circuits -- one prioritizing direct query-based reasoning, the other incorporating contextual cues -- whose relative influences determine the final output. Our findings provide a more nuanced perspective on the stochastic parrot argument: through form-based training, LLMs can exhibit generalization leveraging abstractions, albeit in unreliable ways based on contextual cues -- what we term stochastic chameleons.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22630v2
TreeCut: A Synthetic Unanswerable Math Word Problem Dataset for LLM Hallucination Evaluation,['Jialin Ouyang'],"Large language models (LLMs) now achieve near-human performance on standard math word problem benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K), yet their true reasoning ability remains disputed. A key concern is that models often produce confident, yet unfounded, answers to unanswerable problems. We introduce TreeCut, a synthetic dataset that systematically generates infinite unanswerable math word problems and their answerable counterparts, by representing each question as a tree and removing chosen necessary conditions. Experiments show TreeCut effectively induce hallucinations in large language models, including GPT-4o and o3-mini, with rates of 64% and 44% in their respective worst-case scenarios under zero-shot setting. Further analysis highlights that deeper or more complex trees, composite item names, and removing necessary condition near the middle of a path all increase the likelihood of hallucinations, underscoring the persistent challenges LLMs face in identifying unanswerable math problems.

MAPoRL: Multi-Agent Post-Co-Training for Collaborative Large Language Models with Reinforcement Learning,"['Chanwoo Park', 'Seungju Han', 'Xingzhi Guo', 'Asuman E. Ozdaglar', 'Kaiqing Zhang', 'Joo-Kyung Kim']","Leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to build collaborative multi-agentic workflows has demonstrated significant potential. However, most previous studies focus on prompting the out-of-the-box LLMs, relying on their innate capability for collaboration, which may not improve LLMs' performance as shown recently. In this paper, we introduce a new post-training paradigm MAPoRL (Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement Learning), to explicitly elicit the collaborative behaviors and further unleash the power of multi-agentic LLM frameworks. In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first generate their own responses independently and engage in a multi-turn discussion to collaboratively improve the final answer. In the end, a MAPoRL verifier evaluates both the answer and the discussion, by assigning a score that verifies the correctness of the answer, while adding incentives to encourage corrective and persuasive discussions. The score serves as the co-training reward, and is then maximized through multi-agent RL. Unlike existing LLM post-training paradigms, MAPoRL advocates the co-training of multiple LLMs together using RL for better generalization. Accompanied by analytical insights, our experiments demonstrate that training individual LLMs alone is insufficient to induce effective collaboration. In contrast, multi-agent co-training can boost the collaboration performance across benchmarks, with generalization to unseen domains.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18439v1

Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization: Aligning Vision-Language Models with Minimal Contrastive Images,"['Shengguang Wu', 'Fan-Yun Sun', 'Kaiyue Wen', 'Nick Haber']","Recent studies have shown that Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) tend to neglect image content and over-rely on language-model priors, resulting in errors in visually grounded tasks and hallucinations. We hypothesize that this issue arises because existing VLMs are not explicitly trained to generate texts that are accurately grounded in fine-grained image details. To enhance visual feedback during VLM training, we propose S-VCO (Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization), a novel finetuning objective that steers the model toward capturing important visual details and aligning them with corresponding text tokens. To further facilitate this detailed alignment, we introduce MVC, a paired image-text dataset built by automatically filtering and augmenting visual counterfactual data to challenge the model with hard contrastive cases involving Minimal Visual Contrasts. Experiments show that our method consistently improves VLM performance across diverse benchmarks covering various abilities and domains, achieving up to a 22% reduction in hallucinations, and significant gains in vision-centric and general tasks. Notably, these improvements become increasingly pronounced in benchmarks with higher visual dependency. In short, S-VCO offers a significant enhancement of VLM's visually-dependent task performance while retaining or even improving the model's general abilities.

Can we Retrieve Everything All at Once? ARM: An Alignment-Oriented LLM-based Retrieval Method,"['Peter Baile Chen', 'Yi Zhang', 'Mike Cafarella', 'Dan Roth']","Real-world open-domain questions can be complicated, particularly when answering them involves information from multiple information sources. LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in decomposing complex tasks into simpler steps, and previous work has used it for better retrieval in support of complex questions. However, LLM's decomposition of questions is unaware of what data is available and how data is organized, often leading to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. Recent effort in agentic RAG proposes to perform retrieval in an iterative fashion, where a followup query is derived as an action based on previous rounds of retrieval. While this provides one way of interacting with the data collection, agentic RAG's exploration of data is inefficient because successive queries depend on previous results rather than being guided by the organization of available data in the collection. To address this problem, we propose an LLM-based retrieval method -- ARM, that aims to better align the question with the organization of the data collection by exploring relationships among data objects beyond matching the utterance of the query, thus leading to a retrieve-all-at-once solution for complex queries. We evaluated ARM on two datasets, Bird and OTT-QA. On Bird, it outperforms standard RAG with query decomposition by up to 5.2 pt in execution accuracy and agentic RAG (ReAct) by up to 15.9 pt. On OTT-QA, it achieves up to 5.5 pt and 19.3 pt higher F1 match scores compared to these approaches.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18539v1

We first consult domain experts to curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations, where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks: plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities, with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities, calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23111v1

Prior SRL benchmarks often miss implicit arguments, leading to incomplete understanding. To address this, we introduce Implicit-VidSRL, a dataset that necessitates inferring implicit and explicit arguments from contextual information in multimodal cooking procedures. Our proposed dataset benchmarks multimodal models' contextual reasoning, requiring entity tracking through visual changes in recipes. We study recent multimodal LLMs and reveal that they struggle to predict implicit arguments of what and where/with from multi-modal procedural data given the verb.

NotInject contains 339 benign samples enriched with trigger words common in prompt injection attacks, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Our results show that state-of-the-art models suffer from over-defense issues, with accuracy dropping close to random guessing levels (60%). To mitigate this, we propose InjecGuard, a novel prompt guard model that incorporates a new training strategy, Mitigating Over-defense for Free (MOF), which significantly reduces the bias on trigger words. InjecGuard demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks including NotInject, surpassing the existing best model by 30.8%, offering a robust and open-source solution for detecting prompt injection attacks.

While progress has been made in unimodal domains like text and image classification, unlearning in multimodal models remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we address the unique challenges of unlearning in CLIP, a prominent multimodal model that aligns visual and textual representations. We introduce CLIPErase, a novel approach that disentangles and selectively forgets both visual and textual associations, ensuring that unlearning does not compromise model performance. CLIPErase consists of three key modules: a Forgetting Module that disrupts the associations in the forget set, a Retention Module that preserves performance on the retain set, and a Consistency Module that maintains consistency with the original model. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and Flickr30K datasets across four CLIP downstream tasks demonstrate that CLIPErase effectively forgets designated associations in zero-shot tasks for multimodal samples, while preserving the model's performance on the retain set after unlearning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23330v2

While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01366v2
The time scale of redundancy between prosody and linguistic context,"['Tamar I Regev', 'Chiebuka Ohams', 'Shaylee Xie', 'Lukas Wolf', 'Evelina Fedorenko', 'Alex Warstadt', 'Ethan Wilcox', 'Tiago Pimentel']","In spoken communication, information is transmitted not only via words, but also through a rich array of non-verbal signals, including prosody--the non-segmental auditory features of speech. Do these different communication channels carry distinct information? Prior work has shown that the information carried by prosodic features is substantially redundant with that carried by the surrounding words. Here, we systematically examine the time scale of this relationship, studying how it varies with the length of past and future contexts. We find that a word's prosodic features require an extended past context (3-8 words across different features) to be reliably predicted. Given that long-scale contextual information decays in memory, prosody may facilitate communication by adding information that is locally unique. We also find that a word's prosodic features show some redundancy with future words, but only with a short scale of 1-2 words, consistent with reports of incremental short-term planning in language production. Thus, prosody may facilitate communication by helping listeners predict upcoming material. In tandem, our results highlight potentially distinct roles that prosody plays in facilitating integration of words into past contexts and in helping predict upcoming words.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11630v3
Improving Fairness of Large Language Models in Multi-document Summarization,"['Haoyuan Li', 'Rui Zhang', 'Snigdha Chaturvedi']","Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) is crucial for providing comprehensive views across documents with diverse social attribute values, which can significantly impact decision-making. For example, a summarization system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO outperforms strong baselines while maintaining the critical qualities of summaries.

Enhancing Many-Shot In-Context Learning with Differentiated and Reweighting Objectives,"['Xiaoqing Zhang', 'Ang Lv', 'Yuhan Liu', 'Flood Sung', 'Wei Liu', 'Jian Luan', 'Shuo Shang', 'Xiuying Chen', 'Rui Yan']","Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) without requiring parameter updates. However, as ICL demonstrations increase from a few to many, performance tends to plateau and eventually decline. We identify two primary causes for this trend: the suboptimal negative log-likelihood (NLL) optimization objective and the incremental data noise. To address these issues, we introduce \textit{DrICL}, a novel optimization method that enhances model performance through \textit{Differentiated} and \textit{Reweighting} objectives. Globally, DrICL utilizes differentiated learning to optimize the NLL objective, ensuring that many-shot performance surpasses zero-shot levels. Locally, it dynamically adjusts the weighting of many-shot demonstrations by leveraging cumulative advantages inspired by reinforcement learning, thereby mitigating the impact of noisy data. Recognizing the lack of multi-task datasets with diverse many-shot distributions, we develop the \textit{Many-Shot ICL Benchmark} (ICL-50)-a large-scale benchmark of 50 tasks that cover shot numbers from 1 to 350 within sequences of up to 8,000 tokens-for both fine-tuning and evaluation purposes. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs enhanced with DrICL achieve significant improvements in many-shot setups across various tasks, including both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. We release the code and dataset hoping to facilitate further research in many-shot ICL\footnote{https://github.com/xiaoqzhwhu/DrICL}.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04070v3
Astute RAG: Overcoming Imperfect Retrieval Augmentation and Knowledge Conflicts for Large Language Models,"['Fei Wang', 'Xingchen Wan', 'Ruoxi Sun', 'Jiefeng Chen', 'Sercan O Arik']","Retrieval augmented generation (RAG), while effectively integrating external knowledge to address the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be hindered by imperfect retrieval that contain irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Previous studies have rarely connected the behavior of RAG through joint analysis, particularly regarding error propagation coming from imperfect retrieval and potential conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. Through comprehensive and controlled analyses under realistic conditions, we find that imperfect retrieval augmentation is inevitable, common, and harmful. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome imperfect retrieval in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To address this, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation. It adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments with Gemini and Claude demonstrate the superior performance of Astute RAG compared to previous robustness-enhanced RAG approaches. Specifically, Astute RAG is the only RAG method that achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing conventional use of LLMs under the worst-case scenario. Further analysis reveals the effectiveness of Astute RAG in resolving knowledge conflicts, thereby improving the trustworthiness of RAG.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07176v2

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score.

Despite great success, recent studies show that LVLMs encounter substantial limitations when engaging with visual graphs. To study the reason behind these limitations, we propose VGCure, a comprehensive benchmark covering 22 tasks for examining the fundamental graph understanding and reasoning capacities of LVLMs. Extensive evaluations conducted on 14 LVLMs reveal that LVLMs are weak in basic graph understanding and reasoning tasks, particularly those concerning relational or structurally complex information. Based on this observation, we propose a structure-aware fine-tuning framework to enhance LVLMs with structure learning abilities through three self-supervised learning tasks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LVLMs' performance on fundamental and downstream graph learning tasks, as well as enhancing their robustness against complex visual graphs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13540v3

Inspired by the concept of a visual region in the human brain, we investigate the existence of an analogous \textit{visual region} within LLMs that functions as a cognitive core, and explore the potential of efficient training of LVLMs via selective layers tuning. Using Bunny-Llama-3-8B-V for detailed analysis and other three LVLMs for validation across diverse visual and textual tasks, we find that selectively updating 25\% of LLMs layers, when sparsely and uniformly distributed, can preserve nearly 99\% of visual performance and maintain or improve textual task results, while effectively reducing training time. Based on this targeted training approach, we further propose a novel visual region-based pruning paradigm, removing non-critical layers outside the visual region, which can achieve minimal performance loss. This study offers an effective and efficient strategy for LVLM training and inference by activating a layer-wise visual region within LLMs, which proves consistently effective across different models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12785v2
CCHall: A Novel Benchmark for Joint Cross-Lingual and Cross-Modal Hallucinations Detection in Large Language Models,"['Yongheng Zhang', 'Xu Liu', 'Ruoxi Zhou', 'Qiguang Chen', 'Hao Fei', 'Wenpeng Lu', 'Libo Qin']","Investigating hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs) within cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios can greatly advance the large-scale deployment in real-world applications. Nevertheless, the current studies are limited to a single scenario, either cross-lingual or cross-modal, leaving a gap in the exploration of hallucinations in the joint cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel joint Cross-lingual and Cross-modal Hallucinations benchmark (CCHall) to fill this gap. Specifically, CCHall simultaneously incorporates both cross-lingual and cross-modal hallucination scenarios, which can be used to assess the cross-lingual and cross-modal capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on CCHall, exploring both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. The experimental results highlight that current LLMs still struggle with CCHall. We hope CCHall can serve as a valuable resource to assess LLMs in joint cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19108v1

However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions. While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality. We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits. Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code. While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement. Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03586v2
Multi-Modality Expansion and Retention for LLMs through Parameter Merging and Decoupling,"['Junlin Li', 'Guodong DU', 'Jing Li', 'Sim Kuan Goh', 'Wenya Wang', 'Yequan Wang', 'Fangming Liu', 'Ho-Kin Tang', 'Saleh Alharbi', 'Daojing He', 'Min Zhang']","Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal encoders on modality-specific data expands the modalities that LLMs can handle, leading to the formation of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, this paradigm heavily relies on resource-intensive and inflexible fine-tuning from scratch with new multimodal data. In this paper, we propose MMER (Multi-modality Expansion and Retention), a training-free approach that integrates existing MLLMs for effective multimodal expansion while retaining their original performance. Specifically, MMER reuses MLLMs' multimodal encoders while merging their LLM parameters. By comparing original and merged LLM parameters, MMER generates binary masks to approximately separate LLM parameters for each modality. These decoupled parameters can independently process modality-specific inputs, reducing parameter conflicts and preserving original MLLMs' fidelity. MMER can also mitigate catastrophic forgetting by applying a similar process to MLLMs fine-tuned on new tasks. Extensive experiments show significant improvements over baselines, proving that MMER effectively expands LLMs' multimodal capabilities while retaining 99% of the original performance, and also markedly mitigates catastrophic forgetting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17110v1

To this end, we propose SocialEval, a script-based bilingual SI benchmark, integrating outcome- and process-oriented evaluation by manually crafting narrative scripts. Each script is structured as a world tree that contains plot lines driven by interpersonal ability, providing a comprehensive view of how LLMs navigate social interactions. Experiments show that LLMs fall behind humans on both SI evaluations, exhibit prosociality, and prefer more positive social behaviors, even if they lead to goal failure.

We systematically analyze the effectiveness of different experimental setups for deception detection, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with random or similarity-based in-context example selection. Our results show that fine-tuned LLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance on textual deception detection tasks, while LMMs struggle to fully leverage cross-modal cues. Additionally, we analyze the impact of auxiliary features, such as non-verbal gestures and video summaries, and examine the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, including direct label generation and chain-of-thought reasoning.

However, handling long contexts with conventional transformer architecture requires substantial training and inference resources. Existing context condensing methods cannot accurately understand the full context, as there is a considerable amount of information loss in the condensing process. To address these issues, we present FocusLLM, a framework designed to extend the fixed context length of any decoder-only LLM, allowing the model to focus on relevant information from very long sequences. FocusLLM first divides long text input into chunks based on the model's original context length. It then employs the dynamic condensing process to distill crucial information from each chunk. Ultimately, through the novel parallel decoding mechanism, FocusLLM can integrate the extracted information into its local context. FocusLLM stands out for great training efficiency and versatility: trained with an 8K input length and with much less training cost than previous methods, FocusLLM exhibits superior performance across downstream tasks and maintains strong language modeling ability when handling extensive long texts, even up to 400K tokens.

However, frequently occurring subtle yet critical errors, such as miscalculations or incorrect substitutions, limit the LLMs' full potential. Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically involve applying preference learning to step-wise solution pairs. Although these methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they overlook critical subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or computation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the LLM itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their corresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions obtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO training. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines the training objective without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference annotation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RISE, with preference learning on Qwen2-7B-Instruct yielding notable improvements of 3.0% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH with only 4.5K training samples.

Truthfulness evaluations of large language models (LLMs) have primarily been conducted in English. However, the ability of LLMs to maintain truthfulness across languages remains under-explored. Our study evaluates 12 state-of-the-art open LLMs, comparing base and instruction-tuned models using human evaluation, multiple-choice metrics, and LLM-as-a-Judge scoring. Our findings reveal that, while LLMs perform best in English and worst in Basque (the lowest-resourced language), overall truthfulness discrepancies across languages are smaller than anticipated. Furthermore, we show that LLM-as-a-Judge correlates more closely with human judgments than multiple-choice metrics, and that informativeness plays a critical role in truthfulness assessment. Our results also indicate that machine translation provides a viable approach for extending truthfulness benchmarks to additional languages, offering a scalable alternative to professional translation. Finally, we observe that universal knowledge questions are better handled across languages than context- and time-dependent ones, highlighting the need for truthfulness evaluations that account for cultural and temporal variability.

Revisiting Compositional Generalization Capability of Large Language Models Considering Instruction Following Ability,"['Yusuke Sakai', 'Hidetaka Kamigaito', 'Taro Watanabe']","In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts. However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15629v1

Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments.

Rethinking Evaluation Metrics for Grammatical Error Correction: Why Use a Different Evaluation Process than Human?,"['Takumi Goto', 'Yusuke Sakai', 'Taro Watanabe']","One of the goals of automatic evaluation metrics in grammatical error correction (GEC) is to rank GEC systems such that it matches human preferences. However, current automatic evaluations are based on procedures that diverge from human evaluation. Specifically, human evaluation derives rankings by aggregating sentence-level relative evaluation results, e.g., pairwise comparisons, using a rating algorithm, whereas automatic evaluation averages sentence-level absolute scores to obtain corpus-level scores, which are then sorted to determine rankings. In this study, we propose an aggregation method for existing automatic evaluation metrics which aligns with human evaluation methods to bridge this gap. We conducted experiments using various metrics, including edit-based metrics, n-gram based metrics, and sentence-level metrics, and show that resolving the gap improves results for the most of metrics on the SEEDA benchmark. We also found that even BERT-based metrics sometimes outperform the metrics of GPT-4. The proposed ranking method is integrated gec-metrics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09416v2

To address this gap, we introduce SeedBench -- the first multi-task benchmark specifically designed for seed science. Developed in collaboration with domain experts, SeedBench focuses on seed breeding and simulates key aspects of modern breeding processes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 26 leading LLMs, encompassing proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific fine-tuned models.

So far, efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions, placing emphasis on the ""eyes"" of human perception while neglecting the ""ears"", namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots with ""eyes and ears"" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset, Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model, trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and respond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00421v1

In this work, we systematically investigate reference-free hallucination detection in open-domain long-form responses. Our findings reveal that internal states (e.g., model's output probability and entropy) alone are insufficient for reliably (i.e., better than random guessing) distinguishing between factual and hallucinated content. To enhance detection, we explore various existing approaches, including prompting-based methods, probing, and fine-tuning, with fine-tuning proving the most effective. To further improve the accuracy, we introduce a new paradigm, named RATE-FT, that augments fine-tuning with an auxiliary task for the model to jointly learn with the main task of hallucination detection.

Multimodal Coreference Resolution for Chinese Social Media Dialogues: Dataset and Benchmark Approach,"['Xingyu Li', 'Chen Gong', 'Guohong Fu']","Multimodal coreference resolution (MCR) aims to identify mentions referring to the same entity across different modalities, such as text and visuals, and is essential for understanding multimodal content. In the era of rapidly growing mutimodal content and social media, MCR is particularly crucial for interpreting user interactions and bridging text-visual references to improve communication and personalization. However, MCR research for real-world dialogues remains unexplored due to the lack of sufficient data resources. To address this gap, we introduce TikTalkCoref, the first Chinese multimodal coreference dataset for social media in real-world scenarios, derived from the popular Douyin short-video platform.

TACLR: A Scalable and Efficient Retrieval-based Method for Industrial Product Attribute Value Identification,"['Yindu Su', 'Huike Zou', 'Lin Sun', 'Ting Zhang', 'Haiyang Yang', 'Chen Li Yu', 'David Lo', 'qingheng zhang', 'Shuguang Han', 'jufeng chen']","Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) involves identifying attribute values from product profiles, a key task for improving product search, recommendation, and business analytics on e-commerce platforms. However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as inferring implicit values, handling out-of-distribution (OOD) values, and producing normalized outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Taxonomy-Aware Contrastive Learning Retrieval (TACLR), the first retrieval-based method for PAVI. TACLR formulates PAVI as an information retrieval task by encoding product profiles and candidate values into embeddings and retrieving values based on their similarity. It leverages contrastive training with taxonomy-aware hard negative sampling and employs adaptive inference with dynamic thresholds. TACLR offers three key advantages: (1) it effectively handles implicit and OOD values while producing normalized outputs; (2) it scales to thousands of categories, tens of thousands of attributes, and millions of values; and (3) it supports efficient inference for high-load industrial deployment. Extensive experiments on proprietary and public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TACLR. Further, it has been successfully deployed on the real-world e-commerce platform Xianyu, processing millions of product listings daily with frequently updated, large-scale attribute taxonomies.

The efficiency of SD primarily hinges on the consistency between the draft model and the verify model. However, existing drafting approaches typically require additional modules to be trained, which can be challenging to implement and ensure compatibility across various LLMs. In this paper, we propose CLaSp, an in-context layer-skipping strategy for self-speculative decoding. Unlike prior methods, CLaSp does not require additional drafting modules or extra training. Instead, it employs a plug-and-play mechanism by skipping intermediate layers of the verify model to construct a compressed draft model. Specifically, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes the layer-skipping process by leveraging the complete hidden states from the last verification stage as an objective. This enables CLaSp to dynamically adjust its layer-skipping strategy after each verification stage, without relying on pre-optimized sets of skipped layers. Experimental results across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that CLaSp achieves a speedup of 1.3x ~ 1.7x on LLaMA3 series models without altering the original distribution of the generated text.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24196v1

However, language typically does not maintain a strictly uniform information rate; instead, it fluctuates around a global average. These fluctuations are often explained by factors such as syntactic constraints, stylistic choices, or audience design. In this work, we explore an alternative perspective: that these fluctuations may be influenced by an implicit linguistic pressure towards periodicity, where the information rate oscillates at regular intervals, potentially across multiple frequencies simultaneously. We apply harmonic regression and introduce a novel extension called time scaling to detect and test for such periodicity in information contours. Analyzing texts in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Basque, and Brazilian Portuguese, we find consistent evidence of periodic patterns in information rate. Many dominant frequencies align with discourse structure, suggesting these oscillations reflect meaningful linguistic organization. Beyond highlighting the connection between information rate and discourse structure, our approach offers a general framework for uncovering structural pressures at various levels of linguistic granularity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03902v1

Only a Little to the Left: A Theory-grounded Measure of Political Bias in Large Language Models,"['Mats Faulborn', 'Indira Sen', 'Max Pellert', 'Andreas Spitz', 'David Garcia']","Prompt-based language models like GPT4 and LLaMa have been used for a wide variety of use cases such as simulating agents, searching for information, or for content analysis. For all of these applications and others, political biases in these models can affect their performance. Several researchers have attempted to study political bias in language models using evaluation suites based on surveys, such as the Political Compass Test (PCT), often finding a particular leaning favored by these models. However, there is some variation in the exact prompting techniques, leading to diverging findings and most research relies on constrained-answer settings to extract model responses. Moreover, the Political Compass Test is not a scientifically valid survey instrument. In this work, we contribute a political bias measured informed by political science theory, building on survey design principles to test a wide variety of input prompts, while taking into account prompt sensitivity. We then prompt 11 different open and commercial models, differentiating between instruction-tuned and non-instruction-tuned models, and automatically classify their political stances from 88,110 responses. Leveraging this dataset, we compute political bias profiles across different prompt variations and find that while PCT exaggerates bias in certain models like GPT3.5, measures of political bias are often unstable, but generally more left-leaning for instruction-tuned models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16148v1

However, aligning these models with individual values raises significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the ""black box"" of value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety of value-aligned LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06404v1
Maximal Matching Matters: Preventing Representation Collapse for Robust Cross-Modal Retrieval,"['Hani Alomari', 'Anushka Sivakumar', 'Andrew Zhang', 'Chris Thomas']","Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample, but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise, these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.

The Noisy Path from Source to Citation: Measuring How Scholars Engage with Past Research,"['Hong Chen', 'Misha Teplitskiy', 'David Jurgens']","Academic citations are widely used for evaluating research and tracing knowledge flows. Such uses typically rely on raw citation counts and neglect variability in citation types. In particular, citations can vary in their fidelity as original knowledge from cited studies may be paraphrased, summarized, or reinterpreted, possibly wrongly, leading to variation in how much information changes from cited to citing paper. In this study, we introduce a computational pipeline to quantify citation fidelity at scale. Using full texts of papers, the pipeline identifies citations in citing papers and the corresponding claims in cited papers, and applies supervised models to measure fidelity at the sentence level. Analyzing a large-scale multi-disciplinary dataset of approximately 13 million citation sentence pairs, we find that citation fidelity is higher when authors cite papers that are 1) more recent and intellectually close, 2) more accessible, and 3) the first author has a lower H-index and the author team is medium-sized. Using a quasi-experiment, we establish the ""telephone effect"" - when citing papers have low fidelity to the original claim, future papers that cite the citing paper and the original have lower fidelity to the original. Our work reveals systematic differences in citation fidelity, underscoring the limitations of analyses that rely on citation quantity alone and the potential for distortion of evidence.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20581v3
MAPLE: Enhancing Review Generation with Multi-Aspect Prompt LEarning in Explainable Recommendation,"['Ching-Wen Yang', 'Zhi-Quan Feng', 'Ying-Jia Lin', 'Che Wei Chen', 'Kun-da Wu', 'Hao Xu', 'Yao Jui-Feng', 'Hung-Yu Kao']","The Explainable Recommendation task is designed to receive a pair of user and item and output explanations to justify why an item is recommended to a user.

To address this issue, we propose a personalized, aspect-controlled model called Multi-Aspect Prompt LEarner (MAPLE), which integrates aspect category as another input dimension to facilitate memorizing fine-grained aspect terms. Experiments conducted on two real-world review datasets in the restaurant domain demonstrate that MAPLE significantly outperforms baseline review-generation models.

Separating Tongue from Thought: Activation Patching Reveals Language-Agnostic Concept Representations in Transformers,"['Clément Dumas', 'Chris Wendler', 'Veniamin Veselovsky', 'Giovanni Monea', 'Robert West']","A central question in multilingual language modeling is whether large language models (LLMs) develop a universal concept representation, disentangled from specific languages. In this paper, we address this question by analyzing latent representations (latents) during a word-translation task in transformer-based LLMs. We strategically extract latents from a source translation prompt and insert them into the forward pass on a target translation prompt. By doing so, we find that the output language is encoded in the latent at an earlier layer than the concept to be translated. Building on this insight, we conduct two key experiments. First, we demonstrate that we can change the concept without changing the language and vice versa through activation patching alone. Second, we show that patching with the mean representation of a concept across different languages does not affect the models' ability to translate it, but instead improves it. Finally, we generalize to multi-token generation and demonstrate that the model can generate natural language description of those mean representations. Our results provide evidence for the existence of language-agnostic concept representations within the investigated models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08745v4

Many of these efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn. However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature across language and vision.

Dynamic Chunking and Selection for Reading Comprehension of Ultra-Long Context in Large Language Models,"['Boheng Sheng', 'Jiacheng Yao', 'Meicong Zhang', 'Guoxiu He']","Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately read and comprehend extremely long texts. Current methods for improvement typically rely on splitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation risks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and compromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a straightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of long context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we compute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower similarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We further train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are critical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains robustness across a wide range of input lengths, handling sequences of up to 256k tokens.

While existing approaches have been improved with iterative retrieval, they still struggle to identify and organize dynamic knowledge. To address this, we propose DualRAG, a synergistic dual-process framework that seamlessly integrates reasoning and retrieval. DualRAG operates through two tightly coupled processes: Reasoning-augmented Querying (RaQ) and progressive Knowledge Aggregation (pKA). They work in concert: as RaQ navigates the reasoning path and generates targeted queries, pKA ensures that newly acquired knowledge is systematically integrated to support coherent reasoning. This creates a virtuous cycle of knowledge enrichment and reasoning refinement. Through targeted fine-tuning, DualRAG preserves its sophisticated reasoning and retrieval capabilities even in smaller-scale models, demonstrating its versatility and core advantages across different scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this dual-process approach substantially improves answer accuracy and coherence, approaching, and in some cases surpassing, the performance achieved with oracle knowledge access.

We conduct the first systematic evaluation of salience metrics for SPEFT, inspired by zero-cost NAS proxies, and identify simple gradient-based metrics is reliable, and results are on par with the best alternatives, offering both computational efficiency and robust performance. Additionally, we compare static and dynamic masking strategies, finding that static masking, which predetermines non-zero entries before training, delivers efficiency without sacrificing performance, while dynamic masking offers no substantial benefits. Across NLP tasks, a simple gradient-based, static SPEFT consistently outperforms other fine-tuning methods for LLMs, providing a simple yet effective baseline for SPEFT.

This cost is further increased if a custom demonstration set is retrieved for each inference example. We present Dynamic Block-Sparse Attention, a training-free framework for retrieval-based many-shot in-context learning. By combining carefully designed block-sparse attention and retrieval of cached groups of demonstrations, we achieve comparable per-example latency to finetuning while maintaining on average >95% of the best method's accuracy across strong ICL and finetuning baselines.

Only recently, a paradigm of first-order algorithms has emerged in the theoretical literature, capable of effectively addressing bilevel optimization problems. Nevertheless, the practical efficiency of this paradigm remains unverified, particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces the first scalable instantiation of this paradigm called ScaleBiO, focusing on bilevel optimization for large-scale LLM data reweighting. By combining with a recently proposed memory-efficient training technique called LISA, our novel algorithm allows the paradigm to scale to $\sim$30B-sized LLMs on $8\times$H100 GPUs, marking the first successful application of bilevel optimization under practical scenarios for large-sized LLMs. Empirically, extensive experiments on data reweighting verify the effectiveness of ScaleBiO for different-scaled models, including Llama-3-8B, Gemma-2-9B, Qwen-2-7B, and Qwen-2.5-32B, where bilevel optimization succeeds in instruction-following and math reasoning tasks, outperforming several popular baselines, including uniform sampling, influence-aware data filtering, and reference-model-based sampling methods.

What Happened in LLMs Layers when Trained for Fast vs. Slow Thinking: A Gradient Perspective,"['Ming Li', 'Yanhong Li', 'Tianyi Zhou']","What makes a difference in the post-training of LLMs? We investigate the training patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of the gradient. We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking. Our study strengthens fundamental understandings of LLM training and sheds novel insights on its efficiency and stability, which pave the way towards building a generalizable System-2 agent.

Beyond Text Compression: Evaluating Tokenizers Across Scales,"['Jonas F. Lotz', 'António V. Lopes', 'Stephan Peitz', 'Hendra Setiawan', 'Leonardo Emili']","The choice of tokenizer can profoundly impact language model performance, yet accessible and reliable evaluations of tokenizer quality remain an open challenge. Inspired by scaling consistency, we show that smaller models can accurately predict significant differences in tokenizer impact on larger models at a fraction of the compute cost. By systematically evaluating both English-centric and multilingual tokenizers, we find that tokenizer choice has negligible effects on tasks in English but results in consistent performance differences in multilingual settings. We propose new intrinsic tokenizer metrics inspired by Zipf's law that correlate more strongly with downstream performance than text compression when modeling unseen languages. By combining several metrics to capture multiple aspects of tokenizer behavior, we develop a reliable framework for intrinsic tokenizer evaluations. Our work offers a more efficient path to informed tokenizer selection in future language model development.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03101v1
WiCkeD: A Simple Method to Make Multiple Choice Benchmarks More Challenging,"['Ahmed Elhady', 'Eneko Agirre', 'Mikel Artetxe']","We introduce WiCkeD, a simple method to increase the complexity of existing multiple-choice benchmarks by randomly replacing a choice with ""None of the above"", a method often used in educational tests. We show that WiCkeD can be automatically applied to any existing benchmark, making it more challenging. We apply WiCkeD to 6 popular benchmarks and use it to evaluate 18 open-weight LLMs. The performance of the models drops 12.1 points on average with respect to the original versions of the datasets. When using chain-of-thought on 3 MMLU datasets, the performance drop for the WiCkeD variant is similar to the one observed when using the LLMs directly, showing that WiCkeD is also challenging for models with enhanced reasoning abilities. WiCkeD also uncovers that some models are more sensitive to the extra reasoning required, providing additional information with respect to the original benchmarks.

However, existing methods often rely on black-box models with opaque reasoning. We introduce RePanda, a structured fact verification approach that translates claims into executable pandas queries, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning. To train RePanda, we construct PanTabFact, a structured dataset derived from the TabFact train set, where claims are paired with executable queries generated using DeepSeek-Chat and refined through automated error correction. Fine-tuning DeepSeek-coder-7B-instruct-v1.5 on PanTabFact, RePanda achieves 84.09% accuracy on the TabFact test set. To evaluate Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, we interpret question-answer pairs from WikiTableQuestions as factual claims and refer to this dataset as WikiFact. Without additional fine-tuning, RePanda achieves 84.72% accuracy on WikiFact, significantly outperforming all other baselines and demonstrating strong OOD robustness. Notably, these results closely match the zero-shot performance of DeepSeek-Chat (671B), indicating that our fine-tuning approach effectively distills structured reasoning from a much larger model into a compact, locally executable 7B model. Beyond fact verification, RePanda extends to tabular question answering by generating executable queries that retrieve precise answers. To support this, we introduce PanWiki, a dataset mapping WikiTableQuestions to pandas queries. Fine-tuning on PanWiki, RePanda achieves 75.1% accuracy in direct answer retrieval. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured execution-based reasoning for tabular verification and question answering.

Towards Style Alignment in Cross-Cultural Translation,"['Shreya Havaldar', 'Adam Stein', 'Eric Wong', 'Lyle Ungar']","Successful communication depends on the speaker's intended style (i.e., what the speaker is trying to convey) aligning with the listener's interpreted style (i.e., what the listener perceives). However, cultural differences often lead to misalignment between the two; for example, politeness is often lost in translation. We characterize the ways that LLMs fail to translate style - biasing translations towards neutrality and performing worse in non-Western languages. We mitigate these failures with RASTA (Retrieval-Augmented STylistic Alignment), a method that leverages learned stylistic concepts to encourage LLM translation to appropriately convey cultural communication norms and align style.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00216v1

For models to better understand and facilitate human communication, they must be responsive to the text's implicit meaning. We focus on Natural Language Inference (NLI), a core tool for many language tasks, and find that state-of-the-art NLI models and datasets struggle to recognize a range of cases where entailment is implied, rather than explicit from the text. We formalize implied entailment as an extension of the NLI task and introduce the Implied NLI dataset (INLI) to help today's LLMs both recognize a broader variety of implied entailments and to distinguish between implicit and explicit entailment. We show how LLMs fine-tuned on INLI understand implied entailment and can generalize this understanding across datasets and domains.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07719v2

Existing Privacy Policy Question Answering (QA) systems exhibit performance disparities across English dialects, disadvantaging speakers of non-standard varieties. We propose a novel multi-agent framework inspired by human-centered design principles to mitigate dialectal biases. Our approach integrates a Dialect Agent, which translates queries into Standard American English (SAE) while preserving dialectal intent, and a Privacy Policy Agent, which refines predictions using domain expertise. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require retraining or dialect-specific fine-tuning, making it broadly applicable across models and domains. Evaluated on PrivacyQA and PolicyQA, our framework improves GPT-4o-mini's zero-shot accuracy from 0.394 to 0.601 on PrivacyQA and from 0.352 to 0.464 on PolicyQA, surpassing or matching few-shot baselines without additional training data.

Low-Bit Quantization Favors Undertrained LLMs: Scaling Laws for Quantized LLMs with 100T Training Tokens,"['Xu Ouyang', 'Tao Ge', 'Thomas Hartvigsen', 'Zhisong Zhang', 'Haitao Mi', 'Dong Yu']","We reveal that low-bit quantization favors undertrained large language models (LLMs) by observing that models with larger sizes or fewer training tokens experience less quantization-induced degradation (QiD) when applying low-bit quantization, whereas smaller models with extensive training tokens suffer significant QiD. To gain deeper insights into this trend, we study over 1500 quantized LLM checkpoints of various sizes and at different training levels (undertrained or fully trained) in a controlled setting, deriving scaling laws for understanding the relationship between QiD and factors such as the number of training tokens, model size and bit width. With the derived scaling laws, we propose a novel perspective that we can use QiD to measure an LLM's training levels and determine the number of training tokens required for fully training LLMs of various sizes. Moreover, we use the scaling laws to predict the quantization performance of different-sized LLMs trained with 100 trillion tokens. Our projection shows that the low-bit quantization performance of future models, which are expected to be trained with over 100 trillion tokens, may NOT be desirable. This poses a potential challenge for low-bit quantization in the future and highlights the need for awareness of a model's training level when evaluating low-bit quantization research. To facilitate future research on this problem, we release all the 1500+ quantized checkpoints used in this work at https://huggingface.co/Xu-Ouyang.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17691v2

To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-Ended Benchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation datasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users to generate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, corresponding to specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets, ONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered by the original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Most importantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selecting and aggregating sample-level tests. The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two challenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to the aggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparing models evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, we explore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores. Our aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recovering ground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model ranking with less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithm provides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores. We also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducing evaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. We introduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-language models, unifying evaluations across these domains. Overall, we present a technique for open-ended evaluation, which can aggregate over incomplete, heterogeneous sample-level measurements to continually grow a benchmark alongside the rapidly developing foundation models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06745v2

Prior benchmarking efforts have primarily focused on latency reduction in idealized settings, often overlooking the diverse real-world inference workloads that shape energy use. In this work, we systematically analyze the energy implications of common inference efficiency optimizations across diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, including conversational AI and code generation. We introduce a modeling approach that approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures, online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is highly sensitive to workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators, demonstrating that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption. Our findings reveal that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can reduce total energy use by up to 73% from unoptimized baselines. These insights provide a foundation for sustainable LLM deployment and inform energy-efficient design strategies for future AI infrastructure.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17674v1
Optimizing Pre-Training Data Mixtures with Mixtures of Data Expert Models,"['Lior Belenki', 'Alekh Agarwal', 'Tianze Shi', 'Kristina Toutanova']","We propose a method to optimize language model pre-training data mixtures through efficient approximation of the cross-entropy loss corresponding to each candidate mixture via a Mixture of Data Experts (MDE). We use this approximation as a source of additional features in a regression model, trained from observations of model loss for a small number of mixtures. Experiments with Transformer decoder-only language models in the range of 70M to 1B parameters on the SlimPajama dataset show that our method achieves significantly better performance than approaches that train regression models using only the mixture rates as input features. Combining this improved optimization method with an objective that takes into account cross-entropy on end task data leads to superior performance on few-shot downstream evaluations. We also provide theoretical insights on why aggregation of data expert predictions can provide good approximations to model losses for data mixtures.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15950v1
BFS-Prover: Scalable Best-First Tree Search for LLM-based Automatic Theorem Proving,"['Ran Xin', 'Chenguang Xi', 'Jie Yang', 'Feng Chen', 'Hang Wu', 'Xia Xiao', 'Yifan Sun', 'Shen Zheng', 'Ming Ding']","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in automatic theorem proving using Lean4, where effective tree search methods are crucial for navigating the underlying large proof search spaces. While the existing approaches primarily rely on value functions and/or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Tree Search (BFS) remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether BFS can achieve competitive performance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We present BFS-Prover, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we implement strategic data filtering at each expert iteration round, excluding problems solvable via beam search node expansion to focus on harder cases. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of BFS through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied to state-tactic pairs automatically annotated with compiler error feedback, refining the LLM's policy to prioritize productive expansions. Third, we employ length normalization in BFS to encourage exploration of deeper proof paths. BFS-Prover achieves a state-of-the-art score of $72.95\%$ on the MiniF2F test set and therefore challenges the perceived necessity of complex tree search methods, demonstrating that BFS can achieve competitive performance when properly scaled.

However, their performance may be limited in complex, multi-turn interactions involving users and multiple tools. To address this, we propose Magnet, a principled framework for synthesizing high-quality training trajectories to enhance the function calling capability of large language model agents in multi-turn conversations with humans. The framework is based on automatic and iterative translations from a function signature path to a sequence of queries and executable function calls. We model the complicated function interactions in multi-turn cases with graph and design novel node operations to build reliable signature paths. Motivated by context distillation, when guiding the generation of positive and negative trajectories using a teacher model, we provide reference function call sequences as positive hints in context and contrastive, incorrect function calls as negative hints. Experiments show that training with the positive trajectories with supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization against negative trajectories, our 14B model, Magnet-14B-mDPO, obtains 68.01 on BFCL-v3 and 73.30 on ToolQuery, surpassing the performance of the teacher model Gemini-1.5-pro-002 by a large margin in function calling.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07826v1

However, fine-tuned models often struggle outside their specific domains and exhibit considerable redundancy. Recent studies suggest that combining a pruned fine-tuned model with the original pre-trained model can mitigate forgetting, reduce interference when merging model parameters across tasks, and improve compression efficiency. In this context, developing an effective pruning strategy for fine-tuned models is crucial. Leveraging the advantages of the task vector mechanism, we preprocess fine-tuned models by calculating the differences between them and the original model. Recognizing that different task vector subspaces contribute variably to model performance, we introduce a novel method called Neural Parameter Search (NPS-Pruning) for slimming down fine-tuned models. This method enhances pruning efficiency by searching through neural parameters of task vectors within low-rank subspaces. Our method has three key applications: enhancing knowledge transfer through pairwise model interpolation, facilitating effective knowledge fusion via model merging, and enabling the deployment of compressed models that retain near-original performance while significantly reducing storage costs. Extensive experiments across vision, NLP, and multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, resulting in substantial performance gains.

Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models,"['Zenghui Yuan', 'Yangming Xu', 'Jiawen Shi', 'Pan Zhou', 'Lichao Sun']","Model merging for Large Language Models (LLMs) directly fuses the parameters of different models finetuned on various tasks, creating a unified model for multi-domain tasks. However, due to potential vulnerabilities in models available on open-source platforms, model merging is susceptible to backdoor attacks. In this paper, we propose Merge Hijacking, the first backdoor attack targeting model merging in LLMs. The attacker constructs a malicious upload model and releases it. Once a victim user merges it with any other models, the resulting merged model inherits the backdoor while maintaining utility across tasks. Merge Hijacking defines two main objectives-effectiveness and utility-and achieves them through four steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack across different models, merging algorithms, and tasks. Additionally, we show that the attack remains effective even when merging real-world models. Moreover, our attack demonstrates robustness against two inference-time defenses (Paraphrasing and CLEANGEN) and one training-time defense (Fine-pruning).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561v1

By systematically assessing the performance of leading large language models (LLMs) on Sahara, we demonstrate how policy-induced data variations directly impact model effectiveness across African languages. Our findings reveal that while a few languages perform reasonably well, many Indigenous languages remain marginalized due to sparse data.

Beyond Output Matching: Bidirectional Alignment for Enhanced In-Context Learning,"['Chengwei Qin', 'Wenhan Xia', 'Fangkai Jiao', 'Chen Chen', 'Yuchen Hu', 'Bosheng Ding', 'Ruirui Chen', 'Shafiq Joty']","Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive few-shot generalization on many tasks via in-context learning (ICL). Despite their success in showing such emergent abilities, the scale and complexity of larger models also lead to unprecedentedly high computational demands and deployment challenges. In reaction, researchers explore transferring the powerful capabilities of larger models to more efficient and compact models by typically aligning the output of smaller (student) models with that of larger (teacher) models. Existing methods either train student models on the generated outputs of teacher models or imitate their token-level probability distributions. However, these distillation methods pay little to no attention to the input, which also plays a crucial role in ICL. Based on the finding that the performance of ICL is highly sensitive to the selection of demonstration examples, we propose Bidirectional Alignment (BiAlign) to fully leverage the models' preferences for ICL examples to improve the ICL abilities of student models. Specifically, we introduce the alignment of input preferences between student and teacher models by incorporating a novel ranking loss, in addition to aligning the token-level output distribution. With extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that BiAlign can consistently outperform existing baselines on a variety of tasks involving language understanding, reasoning, and coding.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17055v3

To fill this gap, we present KRISTEVA, the first close reading benchmark for evaluating interpretive reasoning, consisting of 1331 multiple-choice questions adapted from classroom data. With KRISTEVA, we propose three progressively more difficult sets of tasks to approximate different elements of the close reading process, which we use to test how well LLMs may seem to understand and reason about literary works: 1) extracting stylistic features, 2) retrieving relevant contextual information from parametric knowledge, and 3) multi-hop reasoning between style and external contexts.

We use our dataset to evaluate the cultural and dialectal capabilities of several frontier LLMs, revealing notable limitations. For instance, while closed-source LLMs generally exhibit strong performance, they are not without flaws, and smaller open-source models face greater challenges. Moreover, certain countries (e.g., Egypt, the UAE) appear better represented than others (e.g., Iraq, Mauritania, Yemen).

Existing evaluations mainly focus on fragmented constraints or narrow scenarios, but they overlook the comprehensiveness and authenticity of constraints from the user's perspective. To bridge this gap, we propose CFBench, a large-scale Comprehensive Constraints Following Benchmark for LLMs, featuring 1,000 curated samples that cover more than 200 real-life scenarios and over 50 NLP tasks. CFBench meticulously compiles constraints from real-world instructions and constructs an innovative systematic framework for constraint types, which includes 10 primary categories and over 25 subcategories, and ensures each constraint is seamlessly integrated within the instructions. To make certain that the evaluation of LLM outputs aligns with user perceptions, we propose an advanced methodology that integrates multi-dimensional assessment criteria with requirement prioritization, covering various perspectives of constraints, instructions, and requirement fulfillment. Evaluating current leading LLMs on CFBench reveals substantial room for improvement in constraints following, and we further investigate influencing factors and enhancement strategies.

CoRe-MMRAG: Cross-Source Knowledge Reconciliation for Multimodal RAG,"['yang tian', 'Fan Liu', 'Jingyuan Zhang', 'V. W.', 'Yupeng Hu', 'Liqiang Nie']","Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for Multimodal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02544v2
"Mapping 1,000+ Language Models via the Log-Likelihood Vector","['Momose Oyama', 'Hiroaki Yamagiwa', 'Yusuke Takase', 'Hidetoshi Shimodaira']","To compare autoregressive language models at scale, we propose using log-likelihood vectors computed on a predefined text set as model features. This approach has a solid theoretical basis: when treated as model coordinates, their squared Euclidean distance approximates the Kullback-Leibler divergence of text-generation probabilities. Our method is highly scalable, with computational cost growing linearly in both the number of models and text samples, and is easy to implement as the required features are derived from cross-entropy loss. Applying this method to over 1,000 language models, we constructed a ""model map,"" providing a new perspective on large-scale model analysis.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16173v2
ConsistencyChecker: Tree-based Evaluation of LLM Generalization Capabilities,"['Zhaochen Hong', 'Haofei Yu', 'Jiaxuan You']","Evaluating consistency in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring reliability, particularly in complex, multi-step interactions between humans and LLMs. Traditional self-consistency methods often miss subtle semantic changes in natural language and functional shifts in code or equations, which can accumulate over multiple transformations. To address this, we propose ConsistencyChecker, a tree-based evaluation framework designed to measure consistency through sequences of reversible transformations, including machine translation tasks and AI-assisted programming tasks. In our framework, nodes represent distinct text states, while edges correspond to pairs of inverse operations. Dynamic and LLM-generated benchmarks ensure a fair assessment of the model's generalization ability and eliminate benchmark leakage. Consistency is quantified based on similarity across different depths of the transformation tree. Experiments on eight models from various families and sizes show that ConsistencyChecker can distinguish the performance of different models. Notably, our consistency scores-computed entirely without using WMT paired data-correlate strongly (r > 0.7) with WMT 2024 auto-ranking, demonstrating the validity of our benchmark-free approach.

FactBench: A Dynamic Benchmark for In-the-Wild Language Model Factuality Evaluation,"['Farima Fatahi Bayat', 'Lechen Zhang', 'Sheza Munir', 'Lu Wang']","The rapid adoption of language models (LMs) across diverse applications has raised concerns about their factuality, i.e., their consistency with real-world facts. We first present VERIFY (Verification and Evidence RetrIeval for FactualitY evaluation), a pipeline to evaluate LMs' factuality in real-world user interactions. VERIFY considers the verifiability of LM-generated content and categorizes content units as supported, unsupported, or undecidable based on Web-retrieved evidence. Importantly, factuality judgment by VERIFY correlates better with human evaluations than existing methods. Using VERIFY, we identify ""hallucination prompts"" across diverse topics, i.e., those eliciting the highest rates of incorrect (unsupported) and inconclusive (undecidable) LM responses. These prompts form FACTBENCH, a dataset of 1K prompts across 150 fine-grained topics. Our dataset captures emerging factuality challenges in real-world LM interactions and can be regularly updated with new prompts. We benchmark widely-used LMs from GPT, Gemini, and Llama families on FACTBENCH, yielding the following key findings: (i) Proprietary models exhibit better factuality, with decreased performance from Easy to Hard hallucination prompts. (ii) Llama3.1-405B-Instruct shows comparable or lower factual precision than Llama3.1-70B-Instruct across all evaluation methods due to its higher subjectivity that leads to more content labeled as undecidable. (iii) Gemini1.5-Pro shows a significantly higher refusal rate, with over-refusal in 25% of cases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22257v2
Training-free LLM Merging for Multi-task Learning,"['Zichuan Fu', 'Xian Wu', 'Yejing Wang', 'Wanyu Wang', 'Shanshan Ye', 'Hongzhi Yin', 'Yi Chang', 'Yefeng Zheng', 'Xiangyu Zhao']","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The release of open-source LLMs like LLaMA and Qwen has triggered the development of numerous fine-tuned models tailored for various tasks and languages. In this paper, we explore an important question: is it possible to combine these specialized models to create a unified model with multi-task capabilities. We introduces Hierarchical Iterative Merging (Hi-Merging), a training-free method for unifying different specialized LLMs into a single model. Specifically, Hi-Merging employs model-wise and layer-wise pruning and scaling, guided by contribution analysis, to mitigate parameter conflicts. Extensive experiments on multiple-choice and question-answering tasks in both Chinese and English validate Hi-Merging's ability for multi-task learning. The results demonstrate that Hi-Merging consistently outperforms existing merging techniques and surpasses the performance of models fine-tuned on combined datasets in most scenarios.

Inferring from Logits: Exploring Best Practices for Decoding-Free Generative Candidate Selection,"['Mingyu Derek Ma', 'Yanna Ding', 'Zijie Huang', 'Jianxi Gao', 'Yizhou Sun', 'Wei Wang']","Generative Language Models rely on autoregressive decoding to produce the output sequence token by token. Many tasks such as preference optimization, require the model to produce task-level output consisting of multiple tokens directly by selecting candidates from a pool as predictions. Determining a task-level prediction from candidates using the ordinary token-level decoding mechanism is constrained by time-consuming decoding and interrupted gradients by discrete token selection. Existing works have been using decoding-free candidate selection methods to obtain candidate probability from initial output logits over vocabulary. Though these estimation methods are widely used, they are not systematically evaluated, especially on end tasks. We introduce an evaluation of a comprehensive collection of decoding-free candidate selection approaches on a comprehensive set of tasks, including five multiple-choice QA tasks with a small candidate pool and four clinical decision tasks with a massive amount of candidates, some with 10k+ options. We evaluate the estimation methods paired with a wide spectrum of foundation LMs covering different architectures, sizes and training paradigms. The results and insights from our analysis inform the future model design.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17338v1
Comparison-based Active Preference Learning for Multi-dimensional Personalization,"['Minhyeon Oh', 'Seungjoon Lee', 'Jungseul Ok']","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, but aligning them with human preferences remains a core challenge. As individuals have their own, multi-dimensional preferences, recent studies have explored multi-dimensional personalization, which aims to enable models to generate responses personalized to explicit preferences. However, human preferences are often implicit and thus difficult to articulate, limiting the direct application of this approach. To bridge this gap, we propose Active Multi-dimensional Preference Learning (AMPLe), designed to capture implicit user preferences from interactively collected comparative feedback. Building on Bayesian inference, our work introduces a modified posterior update procedure to mitigate estimation bias and potential noise in comparisons. Also, inspired by generalized binary search, we employ an active query selection strategy to minimize the number of required comparisons by a user. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on language generation tasks, we demonstrate feedback efficiency and effectiveness of our framework in personalizing model responses.

While open-access code LLMs are increasingly approaching the performance levels of proprietary models, high-quality code LLMs suitable for rigorous scientific investigation, particularly those with reproducible data processing pipelines and transparent training protocols, remain limited. The scarcity is due to various challenges, including resource constraints, ethical considerations, and the competitive advantages of keeping models advanced. To address the gap, we introduce OpenCoder, a top-tier code LLM that not only achieves performance comparable to leading models but also serves as an ""open cookbook"" for the research community. Unlike most prior efforts, we release not only model weights and inference code, but also the reproducible training data, complete data processing pipeline, rigorous experimental ablation results, and detailed training protocols for open scientific research. Through this comprehensive release, we identify the key ingredients for building a top-tier code LLM: (1) code optimized heuristic rules for data cleaning and methods for data deduplication, (2) recall of text corpus related to code and (3) high-quality synthetic data in both annealing and supervised fine-tuning stages.

LlamaDuo: LLMOps Pipeline for Seamless Migration from Service LLMs to Small-Scale Local LLMs,"['Chansung Park', 'Juyong Jiang', 'Fan Wang', 'Sayak Paul', 'Jing Tang']","The widespread adoption of cloud-based proprietary large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant challenges, including operational dependencies, privacy concerns, and the necessity of continuous internet connectivity. In this work, we introduce an LLMOps pipeline, ""LlamaDuo"", for the seamless migration of knowledge and abilities from service-oriented LLMs to smaller, locally manageable models. This pipeline is crucial for ensuring service continuity in the presence of operational failures, strict privacy policies, or offline requirements. Our LlamaDuo involves fine-tuning a small language model against the service LLM using a synthetic dataset generated by the latter. If the performance of the fine-tuned model falls short of expectations, it is automatically improved through additional fine-tuning using extra similar data generated by the service LLM. This multi-turn process guarantees that the smaller model can eventually match or even surpass the service LLM's capabilities in specific downstream tasks, offering a practical and scalable solution for managing AI deployments in constrained environments. Extensive experiments with leading-edge LLMs are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and affordability of LlamaDuo across various downstream tasks.

AmbiK: Dataset of Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment,"['Anastasia Ivanova', 'Zoya Volovikova', 'Bakaeva Eva', 'Alexey Kovalev', 'Aleksandr Panov']","As a part of an embodied agent, Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically used for behavior planning given natural language instructions from the user. However, dealing with ambiguous instructions in real-world environments remains a challenge for LLMs. Various methods for task ambiguity detection have been proposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on different datasets and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we propose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual dataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is human-validated. It comprises 1000 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences, Common Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying questions and answers, user intents, and task plans, for a total of 2000 tasks. We hope that AmbiK will enable researchers to perform a unified comparison of ambiguity detection methods.

The following three key improvements contribute to SAIL-VL's leading performance: (1) Scalable high-quality visual understanding data construction: We implement a data construction pipeline to enable hundred-million-scale high-quality recaption data annotation. The resulted dataset SAIL-Caption is validated to be of the highest data quality compared with opensource datasets. (2) Scalable Pretraining with High-Quality Visual Understanding Data: We scale SAIL-VL's pretraining budget up to 655B tokens and show that even a 2B VLM benefits from scaled up training data sizes, exhibiting logarithmic data size scaling laws in benchmark performance. (3) Scalable SFT via data quantity and complexity scaling: We curate a high-quality SFT dataset collection with leading data quantity scaling effectiveness and demonstrate that training with progressively higher-complexity data surpasses baseline one-stage training by a large margin.

GRAM: Generative Recommendation via Semantic-aware Multi-granular Late Fusion,"['Sunkyung Lee', 'Minjin Choi', 'Eunseong Choi', 'Hye-young Kim', 'Jongwuk Lee']","Generative recommendation is an emerging paradigm that leverages the extensive knowledge of large language models by formulating recommendations into a text-to-text generation task. However, existing studies face two key limitations in (i) incorporating implicit item relationships and (ii) utilizing rich yet lengthy item information. To address these challenges, we propose a Generative Recommender via semantic-Aware Multi-granular late fusion (GRAM), introducing two synergistic innovations. First, we design semantic-to-lexical translation to encode implicit hierarchical and collaborative item relationships into the vocabulary space of LLMs. Second, we present multi-granular late fusion to integrate rich semantics efficiently with minimal information loss. It employs separate encoders for multi-granular prompts, delaying the fusion until the decoding stage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GRAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art generative recommendation models, achieving significant improvements of 11.5-16.0% in Recall@5 and 5.3-13.6% in NDCG@5.

TETRIS: Optimal Draft Token Selection for Batch Speculative Decoding,"['Zhaoxuan Wu', 'Zijian Zhou', 'Arun Verma', 'Alok Prakash', 'Daniela Rus', 'Bryan Kian Hsiang Low']","We propose TETRIS, a novel method that optimizes the total throughput of batch speculative decoding in multi-request settings. Unlike existing methods that optimize for a single request or a group of requests as a whole, TETRIS actively selects the most promising draft tokens (for every request in a batch) to be accepted when verified in parallel, resulting in fewer rejected tokens and hence less wasted computing resources. Such an effective resource utilization to achieve fast inference in large language models (LLMs) is especially important to service providers with limited inference capacity. Compared to baseline speculative decoding, TETRIS yields a consistently higher acceptance rate and more effective utilization of the limited inference capacity. We show theoretically and empirically that TETRIS outperforms baseline speculative decoding and existing methods that dynamically select draft tokens, leading to a more efficient batch inference in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15197v2
Introducing Verification Task of Set Consistency with Set-Consistency Energy Networks,"['Mooho Song', 'Hye Ryung Son', 'Jay-Yoon Lee']","Examining logical inconsistencies among multiple statements (such as collections of sentences or question-answer pairs) is a crucial challenge in machine learning, particularly for ensuring the safety and reliability of models. Traditional methods that rely on pairwise comparisons often fail to capture inconsistencies that only emerge when more than two statements are evaluated collectively. To address this gap, we introduce the task of set-consistency verification, an extension of natural language inference (NLI) that assesses the logical coherence of entire sets rather than isolated pairs. Building on this task, we present the Set-Consistency Energy Network (SC-Energy), a novel model that employs a contrastive loss framework to learn the compatibility among a collection of statements. Our approach not only efficiently verifies inconsistencies and pinpoints the specific statements responsible for logical contradictions, but also significantly outperforms existing methods including prompting-based LLM models.

Just Go Parallel: Improving the Multilingual Capabilities of Large Language Models,"['Muhammad Reza Qorib', 'Junyi Li', 'Hwee Tou Ng']","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive translation capabilities even without being explicitly trained on parallel data. This remarkable property has led some to believe that parallel data is no longer necessary for building multilingual language models. While some attribute this to the emergent abilities of LLMs due to scale, recent work suggests that it is actually caused by incidental bilingual signals present in the training data. Various methods have been proposed to maximize the utility of parallel data to enhance the multilingual capabilities of multilingual encoder-based and encoder-decoder language models. However, some decoder-based LLMs opt to ignore parallel data instead. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on the impact of adding parallel data on LLMs' multilingual capabilities, focusing specifically on translation and multilingual common-sense reasoning. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that parallel data can significantly improve LLMs' multilingual capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13044v1
